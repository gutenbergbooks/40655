<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noidt"><i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i> is the absolutely necessary companion
volume to Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Shirley</i>,
<i>The Professor</i>, and <i>Villette</i>. Without it the reader cannot know the
real Currer Bell and her people, or see her works as they were to
herself. Great indeed and continuous has been the task of writing
this volume: a comprehension of my duty to law and literature, to
posterity and to Charlotte Bront&euml;, set aside any other consideration.
It could be no compliment to my learned and distinguished subscribers
to assume importance would attach to <i>The Key to the Bront&euml;
Works</i> were the volume a mere skimming of extant Bront&euml;
biography, albeit that has its province of interest. <i>The Key to the
Bront&euml; Works</i>, I repeat, is the only book which shows us the life
and works of Charlotte Bront&euml; as intimately known to herself.
Herein is my task accomplished; herewith is my reward. To quote
my words from a private correspondence with Sir Charles Holroyd,
Kt., Director of the National Gallery, London:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"After her return from Brussels in 1844, Charlotte Bront&euml; conceived
the idea of perpetuating the drama of her life. Again and
again, true artist as she was, she cleared her presentations, till finally
the world had those great works which stand as a signal testimony to
the high value of the true artist, and as testimony to the divine origin
of real inspiration. And now priest, statesman, writer&mdash;whatsoever
a man may be, he will discover in the works of Charlotte Bront&euml;
salutary instruction, and at the same time will perceive with thrilling
admiration the greatness of Art when she is at one with Genius. As
I pen these lines to you, Sir Charles, I am reminded of the evanescence
of the halo of romance round so many historic characters and
personages when sober history speaks apart; but Charlotte Bront&euml;
we find to be a greater luminary the closer we approach her."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>
<p>The utmost possible interest attaches to my sensational evidence,
now first showing Charlotte Bront&euml; to be the author and heroine of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, a book many have declared "the finest work of
genius written by a woman," and some look upon as "one of the
greatest novels in our or any other literature." In view of my
evidence it will be impossible hereafter to convince the world
that Charlotte Bront&euml; did not write <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. <i>The
Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i> in his hands, every reader is an expert
upon the subject. By resort to each indexed reference to Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s methods I have discovered, and named Methods I. and II.,
sensational ratification of all I say hereon will be found.</p>

<p>It will presently seem incredible the chief argument hitherto
advanced against my assertion that Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> was that <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> are "totally dissimilar
in style, thought, etc.," for my evidence is proof absolute to
the opposite. A recent writer on the Bront&euml;s<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> says <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> contains nothing whatsoever biographically, or in any way,
suggestive of Emily Bront&euml; and her personality, and admits upon the
other hand that the characteristic of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s writing is
her full and intimate self-revelation of the incidents of her own life.
Nothing can recall these words. They are a frank, or an ingenuous,
statement of irrefutable fact; and though the writer did not journey
to the logical conclusion, it is well he is associated with this fundamental
admission. The same significant truth is voiced still more
recently by another writer, who says: "<i>Wuthering Heights</i> reveals
nothing of Emily Bront&euml;. Not one of the characters thought or felt
as did the quiet, retiring" Emily<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Much detached yet valuable and interesting evidence I have
omitted for the sake of clearness, but it has aided me in regard to
the final discoveries I now present, and is ready further to substantiate
my conclusions. One of these detached pieces of evidence
shows that the younger Catherine and Hareton Earnshaw&mdash;the two
lovers who at the close of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> become teacher and
pupil&mdash;latterly were to Charlotte Bront&euml; herself and M. H&eacute;ger.
Apparently she did not wish to end <i>Wuthering Heights</i> without a
picture of reconciled relations between two characters who could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg ix]</a></span>present a phase of M. H&eacute;ger and herself. The teacher and pupil
relations between Miss Bront&euml; and M. H&eacute;ger were most dear and
gladdening to her memory. We have a glimpse of them in <i>Villette</i>,
<i>Shirley</i>, and in <i>The Professor</i>, Chapter XIX., where Crimsworth is
reading a book with Francis Evans Henri, whom he is teaching to
read and pronounce English. These two characters represent M.
H&eacute;ger and Charlotte Bront&euml;; and Miss Bront&euml; taught M. H&eacute;ger to
read and pronounce English out of her own favourite old books,
"consecrated to her by other associations," to quote her own words
in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Chapter XXXI., though often in <i>The Professor</i>
she alternates the position of the characters by an interchange of the
sexes, a method of Miss Bront&euml; I have discovered and termed her
Method I. Let the reader peruse carefully the scene in <i>The
Professor</i> in the light of my reference to Eug&egrave;ne Sue and Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s old copy in English of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> at Brussels,
and in the light of the "reading and pronouncing" scenes in
Chapters XXX., XXXI., and XXXII., of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>;</p>

<p class="noidt">Note how in <i>The Professor</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights</i> the male lover
is unable to devote himself to the reading lesson because of the
distraction of the heroine's interesting physiognomy. In this connection
we may glance at the following little parallel of the hen-killing
figure, with which, like the foregoing, I do not deal in the
course of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>. Again we perceive Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s Method I.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre were of course M. H&eacute;ger and Miss
Bront&euml;. It is indeed important and interesting to find at the old
farmstead of Wuthering Heights scenes reminiscent of the intimately
pedagogic relations that existed between Charlotte Bront&euml; and M.
H&eacute;ger of the school at Brussels.</p>

<p>Discovering <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> are practically as
the same book, I have disclosed their relationship in parallel columns&mdash;the
most satisfactory and conclusive evidence in the world. Herewith
we see both volumes agree in scenes and chapters virtually
word for word, and from beginning to end. Both works we now
find are one in origin, each containing not less than four identical
characters portrayed by Charlotte Bront&euml; from her own life, she
herself being the original of the heroine in each book, and her friend
M. H&eacute;ger in the main the original of the hero thereof. Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s brother, Branwell Bront&euml;, in agreement with her estimate of
him as a wreck of selfishness, is the unhappy fool of both books;
while her life-long companion, Tabitha Aykroyd, who was to her as
nurse, mother, and friend, is therein the indispensable domestic
servant and motherly good woman of the humble class.</p>

<p>I will not occupy my preface with an enumeration of the many
important and interesting Bront&euml; discoveries I have been enabled to
make and present herewith in <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>. I may
briefly indicate my chief sensational discoveries:&mdash;The discovery of
the origin of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>; the discovery that
in <i>Jane Eyre</i> Charlotte Bront&euml; immortalized not only herself and M.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg xi]</a></span>H&eacute;ger, but also her father, the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;, her brother, four
sisters, her aunt and a cousin, and Tabitha Aykroyd, the Bront&euml; servant
or housekeeper; the discovery first revealing the history of Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s life at Brussels and friendship with M. H&eacute;ger, the original
of her chief heroes; and the discovery of the most sensational fact
that Charlotte Bront&euml; and not Emily wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and
was herself the original of the heroine and M. H&eacute;ger that of the
hero, as I have mentioned.</p>

<p>My warm thanks are due to Mr. Harold Hodge, who commissioned
me to write my article "The Key to <i>Jane Eyre</i>" for <i>The
Saturday Review</i>;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and to Mr. W. L. Courtney, M.A., LL.D., the
editor of <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>, who commissioned me to write
my article "The Lifting of the Bront&euml; Veil: A New Study of the
Bront&euml; Family."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. Courtney's words of encouragement&mdash;those
of a true gentleman and an eminent literary scholar and author&mdash;have
made bright to me the accomplishment of this work.</p>

<p>I thank Lady Ritchie&mdash;the gifted author-daughter of Thackeray
the writer of <i>Vanity Fair</i> to whom Charlotte Bront&euml; in her second
edition dedicated <i>Jane Eyre</i>&mdash;for her kind permission to use in <i>The
Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i> what her ladyship had written me privately
in regard to her sitting at dinner beside Charlotte Bront&euml; on June
12th, 1850, with Mr. Thackeray and Mr. George Smith the publisher,
when Miss Bront&euml; was wearing a light green dress, an incident
that has relation to the green dress in the interesting H&eacute;ger portrait
of Charlotte Bront&euml; drawn in 1850, now the property of the nation
and in the National Portrait Gallery, London.</p>

<p>I desire to express my gratitude to Miss Catherine Galbraith
Welch, who introduced an outline of my Bront&euml; discoveries to the
readers of <i>The New York Times Saturday Review of Books</i>. I
thank <i>The Spectator</i>, <i>The Outlook</i>, and other organs for their open
acknowledgment of the fact that I have made a discovery at last
throwing light upon Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Brussels experiences and her
relations with the H&eacute;gers at Brussels. And I wish also to thank the
anonymous and scholarly writer who penned the long and careful
article in <i>The Dundee Advertiser</i> under the heading "The Original
of Jane Eyre," containing an encouraging appreciation of the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg xii]</a></span>portance
of my discovery I dealt with in my article "The Key to
<i>Jane Eyre</i>" in <i>The Saturday Review</i>.</p>

<p>I would like to give a pressure of the hand to my subscribers for
the first edition of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>. Your kind letters
to me and your active interest in <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i> will
ever dwell among my pleasant memories. One I grieve will never
see on earth these pages&mdash;the late Most Honourable Marquis of
Ripon, K.G., who numbered with my earliest subscribers.</p>

<p>The readers of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i> will love Charlotte
Bront&euml; more and know her better than ever they have loved or
known her in the past. They will see her books are rich with new-found
treasures, and will recognize her to be a world's writer&mdash;a
character of signal eminence, one of the most illustrious of women.</p>

<p>Truth will out, and facts have their appointed day of revelation;
thus I cannot help it that more than sixty years of writing on the
Bront&euml;s is placed out of date by my discoveries.</p>

<h3>OUTLINE OF CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;'S LIFE.</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">St. Michael</span> the Prince of Messengers&mdash;to him was dedicated the
little church on the hill at Haworth, in the Parish of Bradford, Yorkshire,
whose living gave sustenance to the family of the restless,
ambitious son of Erin, Patrick Bront&euml;.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Is it for nothing that a
spiritual banner is raised by man and appeal made for the beneficent
influence of a conception of definite personal character? Within
this sacred circumscription came to be written the works of Charlotte
Bront&euml;, and herefrom the words of a Messenger went out to the
uttermost parts of the world.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>The mystery of impulse! The servant is not master, nor is the
messenger he that sendeth. Behind the lives of the great was ever
an influence to do: blind may be the early groping of Genius, stumbling
her feet on the rugged road of a darksome journey begun in
the veiling mist of life's dawn, but onward and ever onward is she
impelled to the journey's end. Ere Night blots out Genius her
Message has accomplished. Glancing back to the literary strivings
of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s childhood, and upon those quaint little efforts
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#969;&#957;,
which her young brother and sisters sought to
emulate,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> we see her responsive to some inward prompting that told
her she must write.</p>

<p>Born on April 21st, 1816, at Thornton, near Bradford, during
her father's curacy of that parish, Charlotte Bront&euml; was one of a
family of six, whose mother died in 1821. The story of her literary
beginnings shows them to have been of the kind known to many
aspirants. There were the rebuffs of editors and of at least one
famous author; and, in addition, was the divertisement of her life as
teacher and governess. Her correspondence is voluminous. It was
ever written down to the intended recipient. As to the somewhat
commonplace Ellen Nussey, whose friendship, begun at Roe Head,
near Dewsbury, the school of a Miss Margaret Wooler, lasted to the
end: she invariably discussed the domestic and social happenings of
the acquaintances known by or of interest to them. Thus her
letters<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> are commonly circumstantial and seldom soared beyond the
capacity, or exceeded the limits of the departmental interests, of
those for whom they were written.</p>

<p>This was primarily the result of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s nervous
perception of character and recognition of the want of a truly
psychical reciprocity with her friends. She tells us that of all living
beings only "Rochester" understood her, and her letters to M.
H&eacute;ger, of her Brussels school&mdash;the original of this character&mdash;were
not preserved. In the day of high fame, when she corresponded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with literary folk, she felt herself as on parade, rushed to make
opinions, as say, on Miss Austen, whom she criticized somewhat
adversely. Obviously she hated to be at the service of bookish
letter-writers. Erratically she responded to their promptings, trying
not to be ruffled, but she could not reveal her heart. From these
letters, and the epistles of the class I have previously mentioned,
Mrs. Gaskell in the main wrote her famous biography. The
Charlotte Bront&euml; known of the recipients of this correspondence
her biographer presented, backed with the necessary local colour.
She had enjoyed in the days of Miss Bront&euml;'s popularity a short
acquaintance with her; and when, at the death of Currer Bell,
Mr. Bront&euml; requested her to write his daughter's "life," she was
eminently fitted to give the world Charlotte Bront&euml; as known by
her acquaintances.</p>

<p>But of the intimate Charlotte Bront&euml;, and the origin of the
Bront&euml; works, the method of their construction, and their relation
to the facts and people of her life, Mrs. Gaskell could tell us virtually
nothing. Neither could she, nor any succeeding biographer, throw
light upon Miss Bront&euml;'s Brussels life, or upon the subject of her
friendship with M. H&eacute;ger, who is discovered by internal evidence
to be the original of Currer Bell's chief heroes. Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
was an intensely reserved nature. She built to herself a universe
which she peopled in secret. Her real life she lived out again in
her books. Therein appeared the real Charlotte Bront&euml;, and see we
her life and its people as known to herself. Whether she thought
the secrets of her works would be revealed I cannot tell; but as the
traveller who in far distant lands inscribes on some lonely rock the
relation of his experience, conscious that a future explorer will read
the tale, so does Genius, with the faith which gave her being, leave
her message in the hope of an early day of revelation, and in the
secure knowledge of the final penetration of truth.</p>

<p>We now, sixty years after, find by aid of the many discoveries I
have made and present my readers in the pages of this, <i>The Key to
the Bront&euml; Works</i>, that Charlotte Bront&euml;, penning in her connective
works the story of her life, gave us the spectacle of a living drama
wherein she was herself a leading actor. Herein we see the imperfections
and shortcomings of human nature, and Charlotte Bront&euml;
herself is shown standing in the slippery places. Before our eyes
flits the procession of the people who moved about her, and the air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
is filled with the atmosphere through which her genius saw the
world. In this new light of revelation we perceive her great message
is&mdash;the Martyrdom of Virtue. A more poignant message I know
not! And Charlotte Bront&euml; was martyr in this moving drama&mdash;nay,
I believe there also was another. Spending two years at a
Brussels <i>pensionnat</i> she gained the friendship of Monsieur H&eacute;ger, a
devout Roman Catholic and a man of intellect who, himself once a
teacher at the establishment, as was M. Pelet in <i>The Professor</i> at a
similar school, came to marry the mistress. Miss Bront&euml; went twice
to Brussels, on the first occasion being accompanied by her sister
Emily. Finally, Charlotte Bront&euml; left Brussels abruptly on account,
it has been said, of the harsh attitude of Madame H&eacute;ger, who even
forbade her husband to correspond with Miss Bront&euml;. Concerning
this period and the incidents associated therewith, I have been
enabled to lift the veil. We have thus, for the first time, external
evidence that shows Charlotte Bront&euml;, at Brussels, endured the
greatest ordeal through which it is the lot of a woman to pass. We
see how she and M. H&eacute;ger emerged triumphantly from dangerous
temptation, and how they were aided, the one by her Christian upbringing,
the other by the influence of his Church.</p>

<p>It was in January 1844 when Charlotte Bront&euml; returned finally
from Brussels; and she and her sisters printed a circular in connection
with a project of starting a private school at Haworth, but no
progress was made. Charlotte Bront&euml;'s life at this period will be
better understood by a reference to the chapters on "The Recoil"
in this work&mdash;it was her darkest time: when the human in her cried
out&mdash;as it has, alas! in so many at the bitter hour. She rebelled.
Not violently; but by reproach. Only her own pen can tell how
cruelly she suffered mentally. She had done no wrong and had
resisted a great evil, but the recoil found her weak: it was the
martyrdom of virtue. She was suffering for the sake of right; and
that she cried aloud as in an agony showed her suffering was intense.
The storm left the world <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. The tone of ribald
caricature in dealing with the Pharisee Joseph; the impatient,
vindictive pilloring of her own nervous and physical infirmities as
"Catherine"; the ruthless baring of the flesh to show "Heathcliffe's"
heart was stone; the wilful plunging into an atmosphere of
harsh levity, crude animalism, and repulsive hypochondria, all contributed
to a sombre and powerful work of art grand in its per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>petration,
standing alone in solemn majesty like the black rack that
stretches low athwart a clear sky&mdash;the rearward of the storm. But
it bears the story of a sad Night, and Charlotte Bront&euml;'s subsequent
works were written in repentance: for in Heathcliffe and
Catherine of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> she had portrayed M. H&eacute;ger and
herself.</p>

<p>In this dark hour of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s life, Emily Bront&euml;, to
whom she afterwards gave <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, was writing, on July
30th, 1845,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that she, Emily, was "contented and undesponding,"
and was engaged upon and intended to continue some puerile
compositions called <i>The Gondal Chronicles</i>, which she spoke of
as "delighting" her and Anne. She and Anne had been
engaged upon this effort three and a half years, and it was yet
unfinished.</p>

<p>While making comparison between Emily's and Charlotte's standpoint
at this time&mdash;and Charlotte obtained for herself the names of
Currer Bell from Montagu's book which, as I show, contained the
"plot," etc., of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, for her own use in the Bront&euml;
poem publishing project of 1845-46&mdash;it is most important to note
that but some months after Emily's diary entry <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
was offered by Charlotte to Messrs. Aylott and Jones, with <i>The
Professor</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>&mdash;on April 6th, 1846. The literal evidence
of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i> does not require that we ask by
what miracle the "contented" Emily Bront&euml;, who had collaborated
three and a half years with Anne on <i>The Gondal Chronicles</i>, and
declared an intention at the end of July 1845 to "stick firmly" to
their composition, could come, in addition to preparing her poems
for the press, to begin and to finish <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by or before
April 6th, 1846.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>After Charlotte Bront&euml;'s return from Brussels the degeneracy of
her only brother, Patrick Branwell Bront&euml;, a young man ambitious,
but not successful, as an artist, made him an object of her disgust
and antipathy, and we find she portrayed him unflinchingly as
Hindley Earnshaw of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and again as John Reed
of <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Emily, we have been told, liked her brother, though
an attempt was made somewhat recently to dissipate the tradition.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
But Charlotte, after the deaths of her elder sisters, Maria and
Elizabeth, the eldest of the family, obviously was piqued from
childhood by the advantage Branwell's sex gave him over her
seniority, more especially as he seems to have been brutal to her:&mdash;See
"A Rainy Day in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Childhood," in <i>The Key to
the Bront&euml; Works</i>.</p>

<p>It may be observed Charlotte Bront&euml; went to three schools, and
that each had a remarkable influence upon her life and literature.
The first was the Clergy Daughters' School in the Kendal locality,
to which her sisters Maria, Elizabeth, and Emily also went upon the
death of the ailing Mrs. Bront&euml; at Haworth. The second was
Miss Wooler's school already mentioned, and the third the Brussels
<i>pensionnat</i>. The fact that <i>Jane Eyre</i> virtually opens with the Clergy
Daughters' School incidents&mdash;incidents drawn from her child-memory
regarding the temporary mismanagement of an establishment
which subsequently has proved a most useful foundation&mdash;shows
she began <i>Jane Eyre</i> with the utmost possible fidelity to truth
in so far as regarded herself and her associations. The story of how
this famous work was sent in 1847 to a firm of publishers who had
just declined her novel <i>The Professor</i> is well known history, as is the
relation of the subsequent success of the book and the elevation of
Charlotte Bront&euml; to the highest recognition.</p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> had been published as Ellis Bell's work, a
<i>nom de guerre</i> that also had appeared over Emily Bront&euml;'s poems.
It was issued under the condition that the next book by its author
went to the same publisher, a Mr. Newby, which, of course, made
impossible thereafter Charlotte Bront&euml;'s acknowledging her authorship
of this work, as the next book by the author of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, her <i>Jane Eyre</i>, was published by another house. But there
are evidences in <i>Shirley</i> that despite her nervous apprehensions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
her letters show she was very much afraid of this Mr. Newby,
who afterwards asserted she wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, she therein
carefully placed significations of her authorship of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>.</p>

<p><i>Villette</i> was published in January 1853, and in the June of 1854
Currer Bell married her father's curate, the Rev. A. B. Nicholls,
whom she previously had refused. She married him, it may be, as a
final immolation of herself on the altar of Right and Duty. Her
married life was but for some few months&mdash;it was so short we yet
call her Charlotte Bront&euml;. Her father outlived her by six years.
The last survivor of the young Bront&euml;s, she died in March 1855,
within a month of old Tabitha Aykroyd, her best loved woman friend
and companion apart from her own kinsfolk. Charlotte Bront&euml;,
with other members of her family, rests in the grey fabric which is
the modern representative of that early described as the church of
St. Michael the Archangel de Haworth. Her message is yet with
us; the tablets of her life she has bequeathed to posterity, and the
key to open the way to their repository is now in our hands. Her
genius has shown the price of right-doing and the grim and
dangerous valley through which Virtue must go ere break of Day.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE CANDLE-BEARING BEDSIDE VISITANT AND THE
UNCOUTH SERVANT IN "WUTHERING HEIGHTS" AND "JANE
EYRE."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">My</span> evidence shows that between 1837 and 1847 Charlotte Bront&euml;
was perusing very attentively a little volume entitled <i>Gleanings in
Craven, or the Tourist's Guide</i>, by one Frederic Montagu of
Lincoln's Inn, son of Basil Montagu, second (natural) son of John
Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich, whose ancestor brought
Charles II. over from Holland on the Restoration in 1660 and
therefor received his earldom.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The book, which had never been
associated by any person with the name or works of Charlotte
Bront&euml; till I wrote my article, "The Key to <i>Jane Eyre</i>," upon it
for <i>The Saturday Review</i>, was in the form of "Six letters to a friend
in India," addressed as, "My dear Howard ... now at Bombay,"
and was dedicated by special permission to the Duke of Devonshire,
a fact not mentioned save in the early editions. It was
printed at Briggate, Leeds, by A. Pickard, and published at Skipton-in-Craven
in 1838. Messrs. Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co. were the
London publishers.</p>

<p>Frederick Montagu was a gentleman travelling in Yorkshire
for his health's sake it seems, and it occurred to him to relate in
epistolary form the story of his adventures. He had read the local
writers, but it is most clear Charlotte Bront&euml; was particularly
influenced in the construction of her great masterpieces, <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>, by his purely personal contributions. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was not only as a gleaner of local hearsay that Montagu wrote the
long panegyric upon Miss Currer which obviously resulted in
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s choosing the name, but as one whose attention
had been drawn to her literary eminence. Thomas Frognall Dibdin,
who in his <i>Reminiscences of a Literary Life</i> (1836) spoke so good
a word for Basil Montagu, Frederic's father,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> under whom he had
studied for the bar, also devoted in those <i>Reminiscences</i> many pages
to Miss Currer and Eshton Hall. Thus we read in Montagu's
<i>Gleanings in Craven</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And now as to literature ... Miss Currer is the head of all the
female bibliopolists (<i>sic</i>) in Europe, the library of Eshton Hall fully
bearing out this truth.... In taking my leave of Eshton Hall, there is a
subject upon which I must say a word: it is only the repetition of the
echo I have heard about Eshton.... There was one name connected
by every person with worth and excellence&mdash;one who in the continual
performance of charity, like a pure but imbedded stream, silently pursues
her kind course, nourishing all within her sweet influence:&mdash;I believe it
may be truly said no person is more deservedly loved and respected than
Miss Currer.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">As to "Bell," which like "Currer," came to be chosen by Charlotte
Bront&euml; from Montagu's book for her pen-name in the poem publishing
project of autumn 1845&mdash;only some months before <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> was supposed to have been written&mdash;Montagu says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Kirkby-Lonsdale is a neat, stone-built town, and has a free Grammar
School.... It was at this school that the celebrated lawyer, and one
of his late Majesty's Counsels, the late John Bell, Esq., received his
education.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">And three lines before this Montagu has described the views of the
Lune, "and the prospect from the churchyard, taking in Casterton
Hall."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This is the very background of the early chapters of <i>Jane
Eyre</i>. Indeed, Casterton Hall was the original of Brocklehurst Hall
in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and here resided the Rev. W. Carus-Wilson, the
original of Mr. Brocklehurst, "the black marble clergyman" of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
school at Lowood; while Kirkby-Lonsdale was the original of
Lowton of <i>Jane Eyre</i>. These facts compel us to perceive that
Charlotte Bront&euml; would naturally be led by Montagu's words, to
recall she too as regards her education had been associated with the
locality mentioned. These references seem to have made Currer
Bell relate in <i>Jane Eyre</i> her experiences in that district. Neither
Miss Bront&euml; nor Mrs. Gaskell, her biographer, gave any information
as to the origin of the "Currer" and "Bell" of Currer Bell, but it is
known the "Bell" was not chosen from the name of the Rev. A.
Bell Nicholls whom she afterwards married.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A further personal contribution by Montagu, one he based on
gossip rather than on tradition, was the story of a foundling who,
he says, was discovered by a shepherd on a rocky elevation.
This I find Charlotte Bront&euml; evolved into "a cuckoo story." The
circumstance that this male child was found on the craggy summit
of a hill may have dictated to her the name of the foundling Heathcliffe
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.</p>

<p>I moreover find that, influenced by Montagu's quaint descriptions
of the wild and remote neighbourhood, Charlotte Bront&euml; made
Malham and the valley of Malham the background of her story,
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>. With Malham, Montagu associated the names
of Linton and Airton (Hareton); the Fairy Cave, the Crags, glens,
mists; a grey old church in the valley, the "Kirk" by Malham,
Kirkby Malham Church, which Charlotte Bront&euml; calls in <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> Gimmerton Kirk; a rapid stream and a Methodist chapel.
And he draws attention to Malham, being at the foot of a range of
steep mountains&mdash;"the Heights," and having an annual sheep fair,
when over one hundred thousand sheep are shown at one time, the
which observation was, we now discover, responsible for Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s choice of "Gimmerton" and "Gimmerden," from "gimmer,"
a female sheep, and meaning respectively the village of sheep and
the valley of sheep, a characteristic of hers being that she often
chose her names on what she termed the <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>
principle.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Having in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> made so pointed a reference to
the Fairy Cave in the neighbourhood of Gimmerton, and having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
therein associated with it the names of Airton (Hareton) and Linton,
which Montagu connected with Gimmerton or Malham, Charlotte
Bront&euml; had not openly mentioned in that work the Fairy Janet
referred to by Montagu, though she hinted at "the mysteries of the
Fairy Cave." But I find that her "elfish" imagination induced her
later, in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, to appropriate for herself the r&ocirc;le of the Fairy
Janet, the Queen of the Malhamdale or Gimmerden elves, who
ruled in the neighbourhood of Gimmerton and of Wuthering
Heights, the home of Catherine Earnshaw. Thus we see Charlotte
Bront&euml; primarily associated both Catherine Earnshaw, the heroine
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and Jane Eyre, the heroine of <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
with Malham. And discovering the impetuosity of her imaginative
nature and its romantic turn, I doubt not she was impatient
to begin the tale of the "fairy-born and human-bred" heroine
whose surname she took from the River Aire or Ayre, which
sprang, as Montagu carefully indicates, from Malham, or Gimmerton,
as Charlotte Bront&euml; would say in her <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>. From this came the suggestion of the "Rivers" family,
with which I deal later, the names employed by Charlotte
Bront&euml; being River(s), Burn(s), Aire or Eyre, Severn, Reed, and
Keeldar.</p>

<p>Another of Montagu's personal contributions which greatly
influenced Charlotte Bront&euml; was on the leaf before the mention of
John Bell, Esq., and on the same leaf as the mention of Casterton
Hall, headed "A Night's Repose." This was the narration of a
night's adventure, Montagu telling how he went to a lonely hostelry
and found an unwillingness in the hostess to give him bed and
shelter. He also discovered a mystery surrounded the hostess and
a peculiar, harsh-voiced country-bred man-servant&mdash;who came to be
the original of Joseph of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. At night the
apparition of the hostess appears at Montagu's bedside, white-faced
and lighted candle in hand. It is plain the peculiar man-servant
appealed very strongly to Charlotte Bront&euml;, and thus in
both her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> transcriptions of the
midnight incident this characteristic is marked and recognizable:
in Joseph; and in Grace Poole, by what I have termed Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s Method I., interchange of the sexes of characters. In
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, by her same Method I., Montagu's inhospitable
hostess became the inhospitable host Heathcliffe; but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
each of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s versions&mdash;<i>Wuthering Heights</i> or <i>Jane
Eyre</i>&mdash;a central figure of the incidents she based upon Montagu's
story of "A Night's Repose" was the uncouth, coarse-voiced
country-bred servant.</p>

<p>We also shall see that Montagu's reference to lunacy being an
exception to his objection against the separation of husband and
wife, and the use he made of a verse in his Malham letter, likening
the moon to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"A ... lady lean and pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who totters forth wrapt in a gauzy veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of her chamber led by the insane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feeble wanderings of her fading brain,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">were responsible for the "plot" of <i>Jane Eyre</i> including an insane
lady who wanders out of her chamber at night and dons a vapoury
veil.</p>

<p>And evidence of the enthusiasm with which Charlotte Bront&euml;
applied herself to <i>Jane Eyre</i> is the fact that she at once took from
Montagu's little volume for this her second story based upon the
book's suggestions, the names of</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Broughton, Poole (from Pooley), Eshton, Georgiana, Lynn (from
Linton), Lowood (from Low-wood), Mason, Ingram, Helen,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and possibly
Millcote (from Weathercote).</p></div>

<p>Thus far we see Charlotte Bront&euml; drew <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and
<i>Jane Eyre</i> from the same source; that in a word, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, was
Charlotte's second attempt to utilize and amplify the suggestions
in Montagu's work which had appealed to her when she began
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and we see the suggestions she utilized in <i>Jane
Eyre</i> always bear unmistakable relationship to those she had utilized
in her <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. But the use Charlotte Bront&euml; made of
Montagu's book was not in the nature of literary theft; that volume
simply afforded suggestions which she enlarged upon.</p>

<p>I shall presently show how I find <i>Jane Eyre</i> is the second attempt
of Currer Bell to enlarge upon suggestions that had appealed to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
when she first read Montagu. For a commencement I will refer to
the early construction of her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>. As
simple stories they both are based upon the description Montagu
gives of an isolated hostelry with an inhospitable hostess, a midnight
apparition, and an air of mystery that surrounds the hostess and a
peculiar, uncouth servant, to whom I have already alluded. The
stage properties of this narrative, the characters, and the "action"
or plot, I will give side by side, as they appear severally, first in
Montagu, next in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and finally in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.
Herewith the reader will have excellent examples of the two chief
methods I find Charlotte Bront&euml; employed often when she drew from
a character in more than one work or instance, or when she desired
to veil the identity of her originals. Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Methods
I. and II., being discovered equally in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and
<i>Jane Eyre</i> show, as conclusively as any other evidence, that she
was the author of both works. No consideration whatsoever can
alter the iron fact or depreciate from its significance, that it was
absolutely my discovery of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Methods I. and II.,
which revealed to me the sensational verbal and other parallels between
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> I give in <i>The Key to the Bront&euml;
Works</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Read carefully:&mdash;</p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Method I.&mdash;The interchange of sexes. Thus
the original of A may be a woman, and the original of B a man;
but A may be represented as a man, and B as a woman.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Method II.&mdash;Altering the age of a character
portrayed. Thus the original of C may be young, and the original of
D old; but C may be represented as old, and D as young.</p>

<p>In the literal extracts I now give the reader will perceive that in
the description of the bedside, candle-bearing apparition in <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, Charlotte Bront&euml; followed Montagu almost word for word, and
in the whole staging of the midnight episode at the house of the
inhospitable host in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> followed him entirely in outlining
the story. Both the <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>
versions give unequivocal evidence of being refractions from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Montagu conveyed through one brain alone, the peculiar idiosyncrasy
and elective sensitiveness of which are undeniably recognizable as
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s:&mdash;</p>

<tr>
  <td class='tdl'>My servant having
lamed his steed ...
I arrived alone at a
small hostelry in a
secluded part of the
country, and apparently
at some distance
from any
habitable dwelling.
Having determined
to rest for the night,
I discovered in the
woman who seemed
to be the hostess an
anxiety to get rid of
me; but with the
usual obstinacy of
curiosity caused by
this apparent anxiety,
I determined not to
be thwarted; so,
putting up my horse,
I entered the house,
and sat down to a
humble but substantial
meal, prepared
during my absence
in the stable; and
though comfort had
sway with all around
me, yet there was an
evident air of profound
mystery between
my hostess
and her boy-of-all-work,
a thick-set son
of the north, with a
deep voice and a
sturdy manner;
whilst I, with all the
malignant pleasure of
counteracting any
mystery, secretly enjoyed
the hope of
discovering the reason
of wishing my absence....
I was not
at all disconcerted,
but philosophically
finished my meal ...
and at an early hour
requested to be
shown where I was
to rest for the night.
Refusing to listen to
any excuse, I was
shown up a ladder
into a small room....
I thanked my
guide, and ... laid
down with the expectation
of sleeping
hard, an expectation
which was not
realized, for thoughts
obtruded themselves
upon me, wholly
preventing repose.
Midnight had scarcely
fallen when I heard
voices in the room
below, and by a light
which grew stronger
every moment I felt
some person was
about to ascend the
ladder.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Charlotte
Bront&euml; proceeds with
the dramatic experiences
of this terrible
night she provides
entirely original
matter independent
of Montagu, as a
preface. I will give
Montagu his space,
however, for we have
here a duet in unison,
so to speak, between
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>
and <i>Jane Eyre</i>.
The trio will be resumed
in perfect
sequence after Montagu
has rested a
few bars in the
introduction. My
reader will note
with sensational interest,
I am sure,
that in both of
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
introductions to the
appearance of the
candle-bearing, frenzied,
bedside apparition,
the separate
narrators tell us that
a gale is blowing;
that they dreamed
most disagreeably
twice. The first
dream being in each
instance that of
journeying upon an
unknown road, and
the second dream
that of an unknown
ice-cold little child
(always referred to in
the neuter "it"),
which "wailed piteously"
and "clung"
to the narrators in
"terror," intense
horror being accentuated
by their being
unable to rid themselves
of the clinging,
shivering small
"creature," as Charlotte
Bront&euml; calls
"it." The "doleful"
moaning and the
"blast" play their
part in each version,
and in both a
"branch" is duly
grasped or seized by
the dreamer. For
the origin of this
wailing little creature
see my chapter,
"Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
Child Apparition."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the reader
will observe that in
both <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Jane
Eyre</i> Montagu's bedside,
candle-bearing
apparition is not a
dream, but a candlelit
reality, immediately
sequent to
the dream of the
tenacious child
phantom.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I will here resume
Montagu's narrative:
... By a light
which grew stronger
every moment, I felt
some person was
about to ascend the
ladder. At this
moment every murder
... I had heard of
crowded upon my
brain, and I instantly
determined to make
the best fight I could,
... and with my
partially closed eyes
turned towards the
trap-door. I had
only just time to
make my arrangements
when, clad in
a white gown, fastened
close up to her neck,
with her black hair,
matted by carelessness,
hanging over her
collar, and as pale as
death, ascended my
hostess. Never shall
I forget her dreadfully
hideous expression.
She came up
to the bedside and
looked at me for a
full minute, and after
passing the candle
carefully before my
eyes, left me, and
carefully descended
the ladder.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Montagu arises,
and, looking down
the ladder, finds the
thick-set servant is
also astir with the
mysterious, hideous
visitant. Then Montagu
hears his trap-door
replaced; and
he wakes to learn he
has had the nightmare.</td>
  <td class='tdl'>Heathcliffe, when
he saw my horse's
breast fairly pushing
the barrier, did put
out his hand to unchain
it ... calling
as we entered the
court, "Joseph, take
Mr. Lockwood's
horse; and bring
some wine."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph was an
elderly, nay an old
man, very old perhaps,
though hale
and sinewy. "The
Lord help us!" he
soliloquised in an
undertone of peevish
displeasure, while relieving
me of my
horse, looking ...
in my face so sourly
that I charitably conjectured
he must
have need of Divine
aid to digest his
dinner, and his pious
ejaculation had no
reference to my unexpected
advent.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guests are so exceedingly
rare in this
house that I and my
dogs hardly know
how to receive
them," says Heathcliffe.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Resuming his narrative
in Chapter II.,
Lockwood tells us he
goes again to
Wuthering Heights
and gains admittance
with difficulty, after
muttering, "Wretched
inmates, you deserve
perpetual isolation ...
for your churlish
inhospitality. I
don't care, I will
get in."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "As to staying
here," cries Heathcliffe,
"I don't keep
accommodations for
visitors: you must
share a bed with
Joseph [the country-bred
servant] if you
do."<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter III.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Lockwood at last
is guided to bed by
a servant. While
leading the way, she
recommended ...
"I should hide the
candle, ... for her
master had an odd
notion about the
chamber ... and
never let anybody
lodge there willingly."...
I sank back in
bed and fell asleep....
Alas! what
could it be that made
me pass such a
terrible night? I
don't remember
another that I can
compare with it since
I was capable of
suffering.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I began to
dream.... I had
set out on my way
home, with Joseph
for a guide. The
snow lay yards deep
in our road. We
came to a chapel....
Presently the
whole chapel resounded
with rappings
and counter-rappings; ...
at last,
to my unspeakable
relief, they awoke
me.... What ...
had suggested the
tumult? ... the
branch of a fir-tree
that touched my
lattice as the blast
wailed by....<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I dreamt again,
if possible still more
disagreeably than before....
I heard the
gusty wind, ... I
thought I rose ...
to unhasp the casement.
"I must stop
[the fir bough's teasing
sound]," I muttered,
knocking my
hand through the
glass and stretching
an arm out to seize
the ... branch;
instead of which my
fingers closed on the
fingers of an ice-cold
hand! The intense
horror of nightmare
came over me: I
tried to draw back
my arm, but the hand
clung to it, and a
most melancholy
voice sobbed....
I discerned ...
a child's face looking
through the window.
Terror made me
cruel, and finding it
useless to attempt
shaking the creature
off, I pulled its wrist
on to the broken
pane, ... rubbing it
to and fro till the
blood ran down; ...
still it wailed ...
and maintained its
tenacious gripe,
almost maddening
me with fear.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, "Let me
go!" The fingers
relaxed, I snatched
mine ... and
stopped my ears....
Yet the instant I
listened again, there
was the doleful cry,
moaning;... I tried
to jump up, but
could not stir a
limb....<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hasty footsteps approached
my chamber
door, ... a light
glimmered ... at
the top of the bed.
I sat shuddering yet,
and wiping the perspiration
from my
forehead. The intruder
appeared to
hesitate....<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Heathcliffe
stood near the entrance,
in his shirt
and trousers, with a
candle dripping over
his fingers and his
face white.... The
first creak of the oak
startled him, ... the
light leaped from his
hold....<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is only your
guest, sir," I called
out. "I had the
nightmare."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Lockwood
... who showed
you up to this
room?" grinding his
teeth to control the
maxillary convulsions.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was your servant,
Zillah," I replied,
flinging myself
on to the floor, and
... resuming my
garments.... "The
place ... is swarming
with ghosts and
goblins."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you
mean?" asked Heathcliffe....
"Lie
down and finish out
the night since you
<i>are</i> here...."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I descended; ...
nothing was stirring
... and then Joseph
[shuffled] down a
wooden ladder that
vanished through a
trap&mdash;the ascent to
his garret, I suppose.</td>
  <td class='tdl'>Jane is shown the
bedrooms of the
secluded Thornfield
Hall:&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do the servants
sleep in these
rooms?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "No ... no one
sleeps here. One
would ... say that
if there were a ghost
at Thornfield Hall
this would be its
haunt."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I followed
... to the attics,
and thence by a trap-door
to the roof of
the hall ... a laugh
struck my ear ...
"Who is it?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... the laugh was
as preternatural ...
as any I ever
heard....<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The ... door
opened, and a servant
came out&mdash;a woman
of between thirty and
forty; a set, square-made
figure ... and
with a hard, plain
face....<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; One day Jane, out
for a walk, sees a
horseman approaching
who, in sympathy
with Montagu's story
of laming a horse,
has an accident.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did the horse
fall in Hay Lane?"
Jane asks later of a
servant.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it slipped."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus Jane learns
the horseman is the
master of Thornfield
Hall. She discovers
an air of mystery
surrounds the master
of the house; and a
thick-set woman servant
is involved.<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter XV.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I had
now extinguished my
candle and was laid
down in bed, I could
not sleep for thinking
of the [mystery that
seemed to surround
Mr. Rochester]....
I hardly knew
whether I had slept
or not after this
musing; at any rate
I started wide awake
on hearing a vague
murmur.... I
wished I had kept
my candle burning;
the night was drearily
dark.... I rose and
sat up in bed listening;...
I was chilled with fear....
I began to feel the
return of slumber.
But it was not fated
... I should sleep
that night. A dream
had scarcely approached
my ear
when it fled affrighted....
There was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
demonia laugh ...
at my chamber door....
I thought the
goblin laughter stood
at my bedside....
Something ...
moaned. "Was that
Grace Poole?" [the
thick-set servant]
thought I.... There
was a candle burning
outside.<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter XXV.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... After I went
to bed I could not
sleep&mdash;a sense of
anxious excitement
depressed me. The
gale still rising
seemed to my ear to
muffle a ... doleful
undersound....
During my first sleep
I was following the
windings of an unknown
road; ...
rain pelted me; I
was burdened with
the charge of a little
child&mdash;a very small
creature, ... which
shivered in my cold
arms and wailed
piteously in my
ear.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I dreamt another
dream.... I still
carried the unknown
little child: I might
not lay it down anywhere,
however tired
were my arms&mdash;however
its weight
impeded my progress,
I must retain
it.... I climbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the thin wall [of the
house] with frantic,
perilous haste, ...
the stones rolled
from under my feet,
the ivy branches I
grasped gave way,
the child clung round
my neck in terror,
and almost strangled
me.... The blast
blew so strong ...
I sat down on the
narrow ledge; I
hushed the scared
infant, ... the wall
crumbled; I was
shaken; the child
rolled from my knee;
I lost my balance,
fell, and awoke.<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, Jane, that
is all," put in Rochester.
To which
Jane Eyre replies,
"All the preface; the
tale is yet to come."
On waking a gleam
dazzled my eyes; ...
it was candle light....
A form emerged
from the closet; it
took the light and
held it aloft.... I
had risen up in bed,
I bent forward, ...
then my blood crept
cold through my
veins.... It was not
even that strange
woman Grace Poole
[the thick-set servant]....
It seemed ...
a woman ...
with thick and dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
hair hanging long
down her back. I
know not what dress
she had on: it was
white and straight;
but whether gown,
sheet or shroud I cannot
tell. The features
were fearful and
ghastly to me; ...
it was a savage face.
I wish I could forget
... the lineaments....
Just at my bedside
the figure
stopped: the fiery
eye glared upon me&mdash;she
thrust up her
candle close to my
face, and extinguished
it under my eyes.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now," says
Rochester. "I'll explain
to you all about
it. It was half dream,
half reality: a woman
did, I doubt not,
enter your room;
and that woman was&mdash;must
have been&mdash;Grace
Poole [the
thick-set servant].
You call her a
strange being yourself."</td>

<p>Truly Montagu's description of the coarse-voiced, thick-set,
country-bred servant, and his implication with the mystery of the
lonely house had impressed Charlotte Bront&euml; considerably. Whether
she portrayed him as the Joseph of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> or, by her
Method I., as the Grace Poole of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Charlotte Bront&euml;
respects the original associations of this character as they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
figured to her by Frederic Montagu's little fiction of "A Night's
Repose." Herewith have we evidence as to mental idiosyncrasy and
elective-sensitiveness recognizable as Charlotte Bront&euml;'s&mdash;proof that
her brain and none other was responsible for both the <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and the <i>Jane Eyre</i> versions of the midnight incident from
Montagu.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF THE FOUNDLING HEATHCLIFFE AND HIS NAME IN
"WUTHERING HEIGHTS"&mdash;ORIGIN OF THE INSANE LADY AND
THE WHITE VEIL SCENE IN "JANE EYRE."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now seen that Montagu's book provided Charlotte Bront&euml;
with the idea for a lonely house of mystery&mdash;a mystery which should
surround a host with a peculiar, harsh-voiced, uncouth, north-country
servant, and I have shown how that idea was adopted by her for
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> and afterwards for <i>Jane Eyre</i>. At one time
Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote the <i>Tale of a Foundling</i>, and she certainly
read with interest a remarkable story told by Montagu of a foundling
who, he tells us in the letter next before the Malham letter, was
discovered by a shepherd on the top of a craggy "mountain," a
circumstance which perhaps led her in making use of this foundling
story to name the child Heathcliffe. I will place the substance of
the two stories side by side:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<colgroup><col width="45%" /><col width="45%" /></colgroup>
<tr>
  <td align='center'><span class="smcap">Montagu.</span></td>
  <td align='center'><i>Wuthering Heights.</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='tdl'>On the top of a craggy height
a male infant "was found by a
shepherd, who took it to his
home, and after feeding and
clothing it he had the child
named Simon; being himself
but a poor man he was unable
to maintain the foundling," when
was agreed to by his friends
that the child should be kept
"ameng 'em." The child was
called Simon Amenghem.</td>
  <td class='tdl'>In a wild, hilly country, a
male infant was brought home
by a farmer who had found it
homeless. He brought up the
child, and the rest of its career
is the obvious "cuckoo story":
the child ousts the poor farmer's
family.  It was called Heathcliffe.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The cuckoo story derived obviously from the history Montagu
gives of the foundling became thus the backbone of <i>Wuthering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Heights</i>; but it is possible that the cuckoo story requiring the
foundling should be painted with all the viciousness and cruelty of
character necessary to his part, Charlotte Bront&euml; found herself dissatisfied
with the story. And portraying herself in the narrative as
Catherine Earnshaw, her hero became M. H&eacute;ger. This naturally
led to an awkward clashing. Whether the extreme "demonism" of
Heathcliffe must be understood as being in the main due to his r&ocirc;le
as the "cuckoo," who was to oust the poor farmer's offspring "like
unfledged dunnocks," to quote Mrs. Dean, I will not in this chapter
inquire.</p>

<p>Turning again to Montagu's book, Charlotte saw a further
suggestion that contained excellent "plot" possibilities. This was
the question of lunacy being an exception to the objection against
the separation of husband and wife, Montagu's relation being Barry
Cornwall (to whom, by the way, Thackeray dedicated <i>Vanity Fair</i>),
who was a Metropolitan Commissioner in Lunacy. To Charlotte
Bront&euml;, however, the subject came simply as a useful suggestion.
She had no views upon it, and she desired only that her heroine
would marry Rochester, the hero with an insane wife. At heart
Charlotte was indifferent as to the vital point, even nullifying the
very theme of the plot by making Rochester aver that if Jane Eyre
had been the mad wife, he would still have loved and cherished her.</p>

<p>It would appear that in conjunction with Montagu's remarks on
lunacy and the separation of husband and wife, an extract he gives
from Shelley is also responsible for a wife's lunacy being the theme
of the plot of <i>Jane Eyre</i>. The extract which Montagu quotes in the
Malham letter is where the poet speaks of "The Waning Moon"
as like&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"A ... lady lean and pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who totters forth wrapt in a gauzy veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of her chamber led by the insane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feeble wanderings of her fading brain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Thus was evidently suggested to Charlotte Bront&euml; the hanging
up in the closet of the "vapoury veil" for the stage purposes of the
"insane lady"; and in <i>Jane Eyre</i> Montagu's night-wandering, candle-bearing
hostess became a lady who passed, after the manner of the
lines he quoted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of her chamber led by the insane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feeble wanderings of her fading brain&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">became Mrs. Rochester. Norton Conyers, a house near Ripon, it
is said, is associated with the story that a mad woman was once confined
there.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> If Charlotte Bront&euml; was familiar with this story, and
we are told the interior is somewhat similar to the descriptions of
Thornfield, we can understand that, perusing Montagu's book at the
time when she was utilizing his narrative of the candle-bearing,
hideous-faced, white-clad midnight visitant in a house of mystery,
she would the more readily appropriate the further suggestions his
work contained in regard to a wife's insanity, and the "veil-clad"
apparition of a night-roaming insane lady. It is important to note,
however, that the evidence of my preceding chapter proves indubitably
the "mad woman" was but a secondary suggestion&mdash;the
primary suggestion responsible for the plot of <i>Jane Eyre</i> being that
of Montagu's midnight apparition. And just as the thick-set
country-bred servant denotes in the question as to the origin and
author of the candle-bearing bedside visitant in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
and <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the "gauzy veil" likewise denotes as to the origin of
the mad woman of <i>Jane Eyre</i>. So we read in the beginning of
Chapter XXV. of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, that Jane leaves the vapoury veil in
the closet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at
this evening hour ... gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer
through the shadow of my apartment. "I will leave you by yourself,
white dream," I said.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">Then farther on we read that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her
curtain of cloud,</p></div>

<p class="noidt">which is simply an antithetical paraphrase of Montagu's quoted verse
on "The Waning Moon" which, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">A ... lady ... pale ... totters forth wrapt in a gauzy veil, out of
her chamber.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">And in the same chapter of <i>Jane Eyre</i> we read finally that the insane
lady, who has come out of her chamber,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">"... took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed at it long, and
then she threw it over her head, and turned to the mirror ... it removed

<h3>A RAINY DAY IN CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;'S CHILDHOOD: THE OPENING
INCIDENT IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHIES OF THE HEROINES
OF "WUTHERING HEIGHTS" AND "JANE EYRE."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Seeing</span> Catherine Earnshaw, the heroine of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, was
drawn, as I find, by Charlotte Bront&euml; for her autobiographical self,
the real commencement of that work, in so far as personal narrative
was concerned, is the diary extract she wrote of herself in her earliest
childhood.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In <i>Jane Eyre</i> she placed her earliest childhood
memories at the beginning of the story. I will give extracts side by
side, when it will be seen they agree practically word for word. It
is of course undeniable that none but Charlotte Bront&euml; herself would
or could have penned these incidents of her own childhood.</p>

</table></div>


<p>Thus we see the "volume-hurling" incident with which John
Reed is associated had its origin in some incident connected with
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s childhood and her brother Branwell. As
Catherine, Charlotte Bront&euml; calls Hindley "a tyrant" in this connection,
and as Jane Eyre she calls John Reed "a tyrant" here.
Branwell, as John Reed, is made to tell Jane in connection with this
incident that "all this house belongs to me, or will do"; and as
Hindley Earnshaw he tells his sister Catherine, "You forget you
have a master here." By Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Method II., altering
the age of a character portrayed, Branwell is represented in the
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> scene as a man in years. Without further appeal
it was likely enough that Hindley Earnshaw, Catherine's brother,
was drawn for Charlotte Bront&euml;'s brother, seeing Catherine was
Charlotte. Herewith we find an explanation for a fact Mr. Francis A.
Leyland has strongly emphasized in his work <i>The Bront&euml; Family</i>,
that in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> incidents (the carving-knife incident, etc.)
and epithets known by his intimates to have been common to
Branwell Bront&euml; are associated with Hindley Earnshaw in the days
of his moral deterioration. That deterioration is reflected in the
portrayal of the latter end of John Reed in <i>Jane Eyre</i>; in <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> it is given in detail. As for Emily Bront&euml;, she always liked
and commiserated with Branwell Bront&euml;.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>I hope the attempt to interfere with this tradition recently has no
relation to the fact that I briefly stated in my <i>Fortnightly Review</i>
article that John Reed and Hindley Earnshaw were one and the
same. It is plain to see that if Emily really liked Branwell, as
people stated who gleaned from hearsay, she could not have portrayed
him as Hindley Earnshaw. But a wrong estimate of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nature of the evidence I promised to bring has been formed if it were
thought I should base my book upon such a point. It is enough
that Charlotte Bront&euml;'s private letters regarding Branwell are quite in
agreement with her own harsh portrayals of him in her <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

<p>It is interesting to recall Branwell avowed he, and not Emily,
wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. This fact and the association of Branwell
Bront&euml; incidents and epithets with the book induced Mr. Leyland to
advocate Branwell's authorship. <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>
shows the absurdness of such a claim. Mr. Leyland suggested
Branwell may have collaborated with Emily; and he professed to
discover a break in the style. I find, however, that though there
were violent psychical fluctuations in the mood of the writer of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, the book is throughout the work of Charlotte
Bront&euml;. This may be proved alone by the Chapter III., with which
I now deal: it is the "key" chapter, and is, so to speak, a microcosm
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, as the reader will perceive by help of my
index. Whosoever was the writer of this third chapter wrote the
whole of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and we see it was Currer Bell.</p>

<p>By Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Method I., interchange of the sexes, the
interloper Jane in the early chapters of <i>Jane Eyre</i> and the interloper
Heathcliffe in the early chapters of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> become one
and the same; and Hindley's tyrannizing over Heathcliffe is John
Reed's (Branwell Bront&euml;'s) tyrannizing over Jane Eyre (Charlotte
Bront&euml;). Again, by Method I., interchange of the sexes, old Joseph,
in Charlotte's <i>Wuthering Heights</i> version of the rainy day incident in
her childhood, serves the part of the servant Tabitha Aykroyd, for
whom Bessie in the <i>Jane Eyre</i> version of the rainy day incident was
drawn. (See "Joseph" and his bit of garden, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,
Chapter XXXIII.; also my footnote on page 47.) Thus Charlotte
Bront&euml; as Catherine tells us that when she was banished from the
comfortable fire "Joseph" sermonizes, and that she hoped he might
give "a short homily for his own sake"; and in the scene in <i>Jane
Eyre</i> drawn from the same incident Jane was left to Bessie, who
"supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she
proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned
child ever reared under a roof."</p>

<p>Catherine's story of the rainy day in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> was
written by her in childhood on "a 'red-hot' Methodist's tract."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Hence it is interesting to read Charlotte Bront&euml;'s words in <i>Villette</i>,
where as Lucy Snowe she says she had "once read when a child
certain Wesleyan Methodist tracts seasoned with ... excitation to
fanaticism." As Caroline Helstone<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in <i>Shirley</i>, Charlotte tells us she
had read "some mad Methodist magazines, full of miracles and
apparitions, of preternatural warnings, ominous dreams, and frenzied
fanaticism; ... from these faded flowers Caroline had in her childhood
extracted the honey&mdash;they were tasteless to her now." Let the
reader compare Charlotte Bront&euml;'s reference to Briar Chapel and the
shouts, yells, ejaculations, frantic cries of "the assembly" in Chapter
IX. of <i>Shirley</i> with the references in Chapter III. of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> to the frantic zeal of "the assembly" of the chapel of
Gimmerden Sough. It will be at once recognized that the former
is but the extension of the other, amplified by the same hand.</p>

<p>Thus, in the light of the name Branderham ("Brander'em," from
"brander," a hot iron over a fire) for the name of the zealous Rev.
Jabes Branderham,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of the chapel of Gimmerden Sough, of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, we see a connection with the play Charlotte
Bront&euml; makes upon "burning and fire" in the hymn sung at Briar
Chapel in Chapter IX. of <i>Shirley</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For every fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dreadful and loud&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warrior's delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is slaughter and blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His foes overturning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all shall expire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is with burning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fuel and fire."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></div></div>

<p>In the rainy day incident Charlotte Bront&euml; as Catherine vowed
"she hated a good book," and this rebellion against the thrusting
upon her of religious "lumber," as she calls it in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,
was a characteristic of her childhood shown also in the "Jane Eyre
and Mr. Brocklehurst" incident, where the latter asks&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And the Psalms? I hope you like them?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Jane.</p>

<p>"No? Oh, shocking!"</p></div>

<p>At heart, however, Charlotte Bront&euml; was a true Christian, though
disliking excessive zealousness in the demonstrations of the members
of any church. Read what M. Emanuel says in Chap. XXXVI. of
<i>Villette</i>; the last paragraph. Lockwood tells us in the incident
connected with Catherine's diary that "a glare of white letters
started from the dark as vivid as spectres&mdash;the air swarmed with
Catherines." This, Charlotte Bront&euml;'s idea of spectral writing
running in the air, occurs in Chap. XV. of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, where
Rochester speaks of a phantom hag (see Charlotte Bront&euml;'s phantom
hag in Chap. XII. of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>), who "wrote in the air a
memento which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front."
Says Lockwood in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, continuing:&mdash;"An immediate
interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I
began ... to decipher her hieroglyphics"&mdash;the diary.</p>

<h3>CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;'S FRIEND, TABITHA AYKROYD, THE BRONT&Euml;S'
SERVANT, AS MRS. DEAN OF "WUTHERING HEIGHTS," AND
AS BESSIE AND HANNAH OF "JANE EYRE."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a remarkable fact that of all the members of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
home circle the one to whom, excepting herself, she gave most
prominence in her works was Tabitha Aykroyd, the Bront&euml;s' servant
or housekeeper. For I find this good woman was portrayed by
Charlotte Bront&euml; as Mrs. Dean of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Bessie and
Hannah of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and, on occasion, as Mrs. Pryor of <i>Shirley</i>.
Indeed, strange though it may sound to say, my discovery that
Tabitha Aykroyd, as she appealed to Currer Bell, was the original
of these characters, alone explains the chief mystery of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, and shows clearly enough Charlotte Bront&euml; was its heroine
and its author. In a word, we see by this discovery that <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> is book the first of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s life as told by herself
from old Tabitha's standpoint, and <i>Jane Eyre</i> book the second,
giving her life's story and confession as related by herself entirely
from her own point of view.</p>

<p>Never in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> did Nelly Dean really understand
Catherine, and "the honest but inflexible servant," as Currer Bell
calls Tabitha as Hannah of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, never yielded herself to a
surrender of her rough-hearted but genuine nature wherein Charlotte
was concerned.</p>

<p>"Tabby," said Mrs. Gaskell, "had a Yorkshire keenness of
perception into character, and it was not everybody she liked."
That Tabitha Aykroyd would readily appeal to Charlotte Bront&euml; as
fitted for the narrator of the histories in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> we may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
easily perceive by reading Mrs. Gaskell's further words on this
Bront&euml; servant:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Charlotte was little more than nine years old ...
an elderly woman of the village came to live as servant at the
parsonage. She remained there, as a member of the household,
thirty years [Hannah was thirty years with the Rivers family in <i>Jane
Eyre</i>&mdash;an approximate date, of course, when that work was written]
and from the length of her faithful service, and the attachment and
respect she inspired is deserving of mention. Tabby was a thorough
specimen of a Yorkshire woman of her class, in dialect, in character.
She abounded in strong, practical sense and shrewdness. Her
words were far from flattering, but she would spare no deeds in the
cause of those whom she kindly regarded. She ruled the children
pretty sharply; and yet never grudged a little extra trouble to provide
them with such small treats as came within her power. In return
she claimed to be looked upon as a humble friend.... Tabby had
lived in Haworth in the days when the pack-horses went through
once a week.... What is more, she had known the 'bottom' or
valley in those primitive days when the fairies frequented the margin
of the 'beck' on moonlight nights, and had known folk who had
seen them. [See references to 'Bessie's' fairy tales in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
Chaps. I., II., and IV.].... No doubt she had many a tale to tell
of bygone days of the countryside: old ways of living, former
inhabitants, decayed gentry, who had melted away, and whose places
knew them no more; family tragedies and dark superstitious dooms;
and in telling these things, without the least consciousness that there
might ever be anything requiring to be softened down, would give at
full length the bare and simple details."</p>

<p>Says Mrs. Dean, the Yorkshire servant who narrates the family
tragedies of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> just after the manner of Tabitha
Aykroyd:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you, ... I
could have told Heathcliffe's history, all that you need hear, in half-a-dozen
words."</p>

<p>"Sit still, Mrs. Dean," cried Lockwood, "... you've done just right
to tell the story leisurely. That is the method I like.... Excepting a
few provincialisms, ... you have no marks of the manners ... peculiar
to your class; ... you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly
trifles."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean laughed. "I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable
kind of body," she said; "not exactly from living among the hills and
seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions, from year's end to
year's end; but I have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me
wisdom."</p></div>

<p>"Jane" says of Mrs. Dean as "Bessie" of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chap. IV.,
Method II., altering the age of characters portrayed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When gentle, Bessie seemed to me the ... kindest being in the world;...
I wished ... intensely ... she would always be so pleasant and
amiable, and never push about or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she
was ... wont to do. Bessie Lee<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> must, I think, have been a girl of
good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a
remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression
made upon me by her nursery tales.... But she had a capricious and
hasty temper and indifferent ideas of principle or justice ["Hannah"
would have driven off the destitute Jane Eyre], still, such as she was,
I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.</p></div>

<p>"Mrs. Dean"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in her turn says of "Catherine"&mdash;Charlotte
Bront&euml;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"She was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once
and she defying us.... I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down
her arrogance; she never took an aversion to me though."</p></div>

<p>In Chap. IV. of <i>Jane Eyre</i> Bessie says to Jane Eyre, after the
latter has asked her not to scold:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Well, I will, but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid
of me. Don't start when I chance to speak sharply."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
have got used to you."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Jane suggests Bessie dislikes her, to which is replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I don't dislike you.... I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
others."</p>

<p>"You don't show it."</p>

<p>"You sharp little thing!... What makes you so venturesome and
hardy?"</p></div>

<p>The idiosyncratic appeal Tabitha Aykroyd made to Charlotte
is related identically wherever she is portrayed. That Charlotte
Bront&euml; had been initially entranced by her fairy tales, and the old
songs she sang, is shown more especially in the phases she gives of
Tabitha as Bessie and as Ellen Dean. Thus we read in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
Chap. IV., in the close of the scene just given:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; ... in the
evening Bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories, and
sang me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its
gleams of sunshine." And in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Chap. XXII.,
Ellen Dean says of Miss Catherine Linton (see my reference to this
character as a phase of Charlotte Bront&euml;, in my preface):&mdash;"From
dinner to tea she would lie doing nothing except singing old songs&mdash;my
nursery lore&mdash;to herself, ... half thinking, half dreaming, happier
than words can express." So in the same work, Chap. XXIV.,
the same Catherine says:&mdash;"He was charmed with two or three
pretty songs [I sang]&mdash;<i>your</i> songs, Ellen." The italics are Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s.</p>

<p><i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chap. III., says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bessie had now finished ... tidying the room ... she sang:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the days we went agipsying<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A long time ago."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
Bessie had a sweet voice&mdash;at least I thought so. But now, though her
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low,
very lingeringly: "a long time ago," came like the saddest cadence of a
funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad.</p></div>

<p>Tabby Aykroyd going to the Parsonage when the motherless
Charlotte Bront&euml; was but nine, Charlotte seems to have been drawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to look upon her as a new-found friend, and afterwards she idealized
those memories associated with her. It is noticeable she had been
impressed in childhood by her singing and the sympathetic sweetness
of her voice. There is a world of meaning&mdash;a gracious waiving aside
of qualifying fact in the sentence, "Bessie had a sweet voice&mdash;at
least I thought so." Charlotte was fond of Scottish ballads, and in
<i>Villette</i>, Chapter XXV., she identifies herself in her phase as Paulina
(see my further reference to this phase of Charlotte Bront&euml;) with a
a love for a Scottish song. With Tabitha Aykroyd she loved to
associate the singing of her favourite ballads, as we have seen in her
reference to the songs of Tabitha in her phases as Bessie of <i>Jane
Eyre</i> and Mrs. Dean of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. And so it is we find
Mrs. Dean telling us in Chapter IX. of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, 'I was
rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was far in the night and the bairnies grat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mither beneath the mools heard that."'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whether traits of Nancy Garrs or her sister, or Martha Brown,
the other Bront&euml; servants, contributed to Charlotte's portrayal is
doubtful. I think they did not. We see in this chapter the original
of Bessie of <i>Jane Eyre</i> was certainly the original of Mrs. Dean of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>&mdash;Tabitha Aykroyd; and as Charlotte Bront&euml;
portrayed Mrs. Dean as an elderly woman servant, before she began
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, we must decide the question of the real age of the
original of Bessie by that fact. Confirming is the portrayal of the
same character by Charlotte as the elderly Hannah in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.
See my chapter on "The Rivers or Bront&euml; Family."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Of "Dean" or Tabitha Aykroyd in the r&ocirc;le of Hannah of the
family "Jane" says:&mdash;"I had a feeling that she did not understand
me, ... that she was prejudiced against me." Nevertheless she
says to her: "You ... have been an honest and faithful servant,
I will say so much for you."</p>

<p>Much stress is placed by Tabitha Aykroyd, as Nelly Dean, and
Bessie, on Charlotte Bront&euml;'s passionateness. Says Mrs. Dean of
Catherine in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much,
she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in
his eyes, for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her, ...
serious threats of a fit ... often attended her rages."</p></div>

<p>Thus I find there is a connection between Catherine's "fit of
frenzy" and delirium in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Chapters XI. and
XII., and the scenes attendant upon Jane's fit of frenzy in <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, Chapters I., II., III. The one is told by Charlotte as
from Tabitha Aykroyd's (Bessie's) standpoint, the other from
Catherine's (Charlotte Bront&euml;'s), an inversion of attitude which
proves Charlotte Bront&euml; to be the author and heroine of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>.</p>

matter," ... and I [Tabitha&mdash;Mrs.
Dean] told him how she
had resolved ... on exhibiting
a fit of frenzy. I incautiously
gave the account aloud, ... she
[Charlotte Bront&euml;] started up
... and then rushed from the
room. The master directed me
to follow; I did to her chamber
door; she ... secured it against
me.... On the third day
Catherine [Charlotte Bront&euml;] un-barred
her door, ... desired a
basin of gruel, for she believed
she was dying.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "These ... awful nights;
I've never closed my lids&mdash;and
oh!... I've been ...
haunted, Nelly! [Tabitha]. But
I begin to fancy you don't like
me.... They have all turned to
enemies; ... <i>they</i> have, the
people <i>here</i>."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Tossing about, she increased
her feverish bewilderment of
madness.... "Don't you see
that face?" she inquired, gazing
nervously at the mirror....
"Oh! Nelly [Tabitha], the room
is haunted! I'm afraid of being
left alone...."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I [Nelly Dean&mdash;Tabitha] attempted
to steal to the door
... but I was summoned back
by a piercing scream.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... "As soon as ever I
barred the door," proceeded
Catherine [Charlotte Bront&euml;],
"utter darkness overwhelmed me,
and I fell on the floor. I
couldn't explain ... how certain
I felt of having a fit, or
going mad."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "A sound sleep would do you
good," said Nelly Dean&mdash;Tabitha
Aykroyd.</td>
  <td class='tdl'>I [Jane&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml;] sat
looking at the white bed, ...
occasionally turning a fascinated
eye towards the ... mirror....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
I hushed my sobs, fearful lest
... signs of grief might waken
a preternatural voice ... or
elicit from the gloom some haloed
face.... This ... I felt would
be terrible.... At this moment
a light gleamed on the wall; ...
shaken as my nerves were by
agitation, I thought the swift-darting
beam was a herald of
some coming vision from another
world. My heart beat thick, my
head grew hot; a sound filled
my ears which I deemed the
rushing of wings: something
seemed near me; I was oppressed,
suffocated; endurance broke
down; I rushed to the door
and shook the lock in desperate
effort. Steps came running along
the ... passage, ... Bessie
and Abbot entered.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said
Bessie [Tabitha Aykroyd].<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a dreadful noise! It
went through me!" exclaimed
Abbot.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me out!" was my cry.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... Are you hurt? Have
you seen something?" demanded
Bessie [Tabitha].<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! I ... thought a ghost
would come."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "She has screamed on purpose,"
declared Abbot [?]....
"And what a scream! If she had
been in pain one would have
excused it, but she only wanted
to bring us all here: I know her
naughty tricks."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Mrs. Reed [Aunt Branwell]
came.... "Silence!" she
exclaimed; "this scene is repulsive."
I was a precocious actor
in her eyes. She sincerely looked
upon me [Charlotte] as a compound
of virulent passions, mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
spirit, and dangerous duplicity....
I suppose I had a species
of fit: unconsciousness closed
the scene.... The next thing I
remembered is waking ... with
a feeling as if I had had a frightful
nightmare ... agitation, uncertainty,
and a predominant
sense of terror confused my
faculties.... Bessie [Tabby]
stood at the bed-foot with a
basin in her hand.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel as if you could
sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie
[Tabitha Aykroyd] rather softly.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; For me [Charlotte] the watches
of that long night passed in
ghostly watchfulness; ear, eye,
and mind were alike strained by
dread, such dread as children
only can feel.</td>

<p>By her Method II.: altering the age of a character portrayed,
Charlotte Bront&euml; gives us Tabitha Aykroyd as a young woman in
Bessie; and by the same Method II, in the scene just read from
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, we have an instance of her presenting, as an
incident in womanhood, an incident which the testimony of <i>Jane
Eyre</i> and other evidences show occurred really in Charlotte's own
childhood. As she relates in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, her dread was "such dread
as children only can feel"; and she goes on to say "this incident
[of the locked room] gave my nerves a shock of which I feel
the reverberation to this day." Thus in both <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
and <i>Jane Eyre</i> Charlotte paints an excellent picture of the matter-of-fact
but good-hearted Tabitha Aykroyd going to the room in
response to her, Charlotte Bront&euml;'s, frantic appeal, sceptical and
certainly unsympathetic.</p>

<p>The part played by the wild summoning of Tabitha to the room,
the references to "a fit," the ghost and haunted chamber, the dread
of the mirror, the suggestion that the frenzy of fear was wilfully
assumed, the piercing scream, Tabitha Aykroyd with her basin and
her final suggestion of sleep, are in themselves ample evidence that
Charlotte Bront&euml; in both <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
this scene from an experience of the kind in her own childhood. In
each work stress is laid by her upon her own hypersensitiveness, and
we learn how the Bront&euml; household misunderstood her excessive
passionateness and misread it as wicked acting<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>We see Tabitha best in Mrs. Dean of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, as
Hannah of the Rivers family of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and by Currer Bell's
Method II., alteration of age of the character portrayed, as Bessie
of that work. Tabitha Aykroyd lives and breathes her life through
the pages of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>
to-day, and ever will she remain in literature, a real Yorkshire
woman amazingly translated from the wide Yorkshire hearth with its
great, wind-whitened fire and smell of hot cakes, to the pages of two
of the finest examples of the English novel. Her portrayal I declare
to be one of the most admirable achievements in the works of
Charlotte Bront&euml;.</p>

<h3>CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;'S CHILD APPARITION IN "THE PROFESSOR,"
"WUTHERING HEIGHTS," AND "JANE EYRE."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gaskell</span>, the Bront&euml; biographer, relates that a friend of
Charlotte Bront&euml; said Charlotte had told her "a misfortune was
often preceded by the dream which she gives to Jane Eyre of carrying
a wailing child. She, Charlotte Bront&euml;, described herself as
having the most painful sense of pity for the little thing.... The
misfortunes she mentioned were not always to herself. She thought
such sensitiveness to omens was ... present to susceptible
people...." This in the main explains the origin of the child-apparition
as an omen of disaster in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s works.</p>

<p>It would seem by Charlotte's statement in <i>Jane Eyre</i> that
Tabitha Aykroyd, as "Bessie," was responsible for the origin of this
little superstition; and it is instructive to find the child-apparition
as an ill-omen in connection with Tabitha Aykroyd as Mrs. Dean
in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. I have shown John Reed and Hindley
Earnshaw represent Branwell Bront&euml;; we may notice, therefore, that
the child-apparition is given equally in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and in
<i>Jane Eyre</i> as coming before disaster or disgrace to Branwell Bront&euml;.</p>

waiting for me; ... he was ...
in deep mourning, and the hat
in his hand was surrounded with

had got into great trouble and
was dead.</td>

<p>Branwell Bront&euml; was not dead when Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote
those two versions, but it seems certain that an apparition of a
child in some period of Charlotte's life preceded a further debasement
of Branwell, the original of Hindley Earnshaw and John
Reed. We may note Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Method II., in regard to
Hindley.</p>

<p>In Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <i>The Professor</i> we find reference to her child-phantom
wailing outside, and to the eerie, premonitory signal made
against a lattice, as in her <i>Wuthering Heights</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>In <i>Wuthering Heights</i> Charlotte Bront&euml; has worked the child-phantom
into the story proper, setting it for the spirit of the departed
Catherine, who as a child again (Method II., altering age of the
character portrayed) seeks Heathcliffe. The building of the child-phantom
in the plot of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> created a peculiar state of
affairs; but as we have seen by Charlotte Bront&euml;'s reference to it in
the extract from <i>The Professor</i>, she was impressed by its possibilities
of giving a weird spiritual atmosphere, and she did not extend the
idea in <i>The Professor</i>. The substance of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s two
versions of the child-phantom wailing outside a house for admittance
is identical:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus we perceive the famous child-phantom incident in Chapter
III. of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> had its origin (1) in Montagu's lonely-house
incident; (2) in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s awe of a child-apparition; (3) in
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Method II., alteration of age of character portrayed,
by which Catherine the woman becomes a child again; and
(4) in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s notion, as evidenced in <i>Shirley</i>, Chapter
XXIV., that a loved dead one can "revisit those they leave"; can
"come in the elements"; that "wind" could give "a path to
Moor(e)"&mdash;Heath(cliffe), "passing the casement sobbing"; that the
loved dead one could "haunt" the wind. These, then, we see were
the notions in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s head responsible for Catherine's
returning so sensationally to the abode of her lover as a child-spectre.
For Catherine's love for Wuthering Heights was not simply because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of the place and its moors, as so many writers have wrongly contended,
but because it was associated with Heathcliffe.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Let my
reader peruse again the "wailing child" passages I quote from
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> in Chapter II. of <i>The Key to the
Bront&euml; Works</i>.</p>

<p>Truly the testimony of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s child-phantom were
alone the sign-manual that she and none other wrote <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGINALS OF GIMMERTON, GIMMERDEN, GIMMERTON KIRK
AND CHAPEL, PENISTON CRAGS, THE FAIRY CAVE, ETC., IN
"WUTHERING HEIGHTS," AND OF THE FAIRY CAVE AND THE
FAIRY JANET IN "JANE EYRE."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> uncommon stress Charlotte Bront&euml; has laid upon the outlandishness
of the <i>Wuthering Heights</i> country and its solitudes
assuredly would have been absent from that work had she drawn
her background from the comparatively characterless Haworth moors
on the skirts of manufacturing towns, and not from impressions
created in her mind by Montagu's description in his <i>Gleanings in
Craven</i> of the wildest and weirdest scenery in Yorkshire. There
has been a noticeable tendency on the part of town-bred, and also
of romantic, biographers to be awed by the ordinary moorland
surroundings of Haworth, and to associate with them all the
wildness of the Craven or Scottish Highlands, though Miss Mary
Robinson, whose work entitled <i>Emily Bront&euml;</i> is in effect an "appreciation"
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, says frankly regarding the house
standing beyond the street on the summit of Haworth Hill, shown
as the original of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, that to her thinking "this
fine old farm of the Sowdens is far too near the mills of Haworth
to represent the God-forsaken, lonely house." But of course an
author can place a given abode against any background. Wuthering
Heights has been connected by some people with a locality called
Withins&mdash;how wrongly a reference to the origin of Gimmerton and
Gimmerden alone shows. The primary origin of the name and
title of "Wuthering Heights" I reveal in the final chapter on
"The Recoil."</p>

<p>The following passage from <i>Wuthering Heights</i> tells that Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s imagination was enjoying the latitude of a half-realized,
suggested background. It reads just like the traveller Montagu
with his horse, attendant servant on horseback, roadside inns,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
hostlers, and description of country. But the connection of
Montagu with Lockwood of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> we have already
seen in the early chapters of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1802&mdash;This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a
friend in the North, and on my journey ... I unexpectedly came within
fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The hostler at a roadside public-house
was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses when a cart of very
green oats ... passed by, and he remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yon's frough Gimmerton, nah! They're allus three wick after other
folk wi' ther harvest."</p>

<p>"Gimmerton?" I repeated; my residence in that locality had already
grown dim and dreamy. "Ah, I know. How far is it from this?"</p>

<p>"Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road." A sudden
impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely noon,
and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own roof
as in an inn.... Having rested a while, I directed my servant to inquire
the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we managed
the distance in some three hours. I left him there, and proceeded ...
down the valley alone. The grey church looked greyer, and the churchyard
lonelier. I distinguished a moor sheep cropping the short turf on
the graves.... The heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful
scenery above and below; had I seen it nearer August, I'm sure it would
have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes. [Be it observed
he would rather have done so than have gone to "the moors" of his
friend.] In winter nothing more dreary than those glens shut in by
hills,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and those bluff, bold swells of heath.</p></div>

<p>So we too would imagine, judging by Montagu's description of
the district in his little work.</p>

<p>Throughout <i>Wuthering Heights</i> we hear mention of Gimmerton,
but it is apparent the village was "dim and dreamy" to Charlotte
Bront&euml;&mdash;somewhere about the little valley we should imagine, to
conclude by general observations. However, clear it is that Gimmerton
and Gimmerden were drawn by Charlotte Bront&euml; merely
from impressions created in her mind by other than a personal
acquaintance with the district. Where then, and in what peculiar
circumstances, did Charlotte receive these suggestions&mdash;suggestions
that must have appealed to her at a time immediately coincident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
with her commencing this foundling story with the house of mystery,
the inhospitable host, the uncouth man-servant, and the candle-bearing
bedside visitant&mdash;all from Montagu's book? My evidence
declares these suggestions also came from Montagu's little work,
and that the originals of Gimmerton in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and
Gimmerden, or the valley of Gimmerton, were Malham and Malhamdale,
or the valley of Malham. This district Montagu describes
as being "most interesting ... in its own variety of wildness."</p>

<p>I believe Kilnsey Crags, which Montagu describes on the last page
of the letter next to that written from Malham, figured in Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s mind as the originals of Peniston Crags ("Peniston"
may have been suggested by Montagu's mention of Pennigent).
Montagu's description of Kilnsey Crags I will place side by side
with the reference to Peniston Crags in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Clearly Joseph's "leading of lime" from Peniston Crags in

being limestone. Dean describes them to Cathy, and her words

Catherine Linton's was, with the mention of the Fairy Cave; and
<i>Jane Eyre</i> is testimony that after writing <i>Wuthering Heights</i> she
turned again to consider its possibilities of suggestion.</p>

<p>In fact, I find that Charlotte Bront&euml; when she chose the name
of Janet Eyre for herself was also calling herself the Fairy Janet.
And where, then, read Charlotte Bront&euml; of the fairy Janet Eyre?
The evidence of Montagu's work proves that when she wrote the
name Eyre, she was implying by this Derbyshire variant the name
Aire or Ayre, meaning the river Ayre. Where acquired Charlotte
Bront&euml; so intimate an acquaintance with the history of the Fairy
Janet of the Aire as to take upon herself poetically, the r&ocirc;le of that
Craven elf and her name?</p>

<p>Mr. Harry Speight recently, in <i>The Craven Highlands</i>, told us
"the Fairy Jennet or Janet was queen of the Malhamdale elves"
who frequented the enchanted ground round the source of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Aire. But prior to Montagu's dealing with Janet's Cave, the
home of the Malhamdale fays, the queen-elf had been referred to
as Gennet. Montagu spelt the name Jannet, and later writers having
referred to him, the fairy cave now bears the name Janet's Cave.
A Malham writer prior to Montagu referred only briefly to the Fairy
Cave, and quite prosily. In his Malham letter Montagu says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leaving a farmhouse at the entrance of the vale to the
left, we [he and his boy-guide] proceeded over two fields, then
ascended about twenty yards, suddenly turned an acute angle, and
penetrating some bushes we stood at the entrance of a deep and
narrow glen, before a perpendicular fall of water. At the foot of this
cascade is</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jannet's Cave.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">It is so called from the queen or governess of a numerous tribe of
faeries, which tradition assures us anciently held their court here; and
as there may be some of my readers who may like at the moonlit
hour to be entertained at one of Jannet's banquets, I will give an
idea as to the mode of obtaining admission into such society....
On the evening when I first learned the mystic lore, the golden
sun had kissed every flower, even unto the retiring lily, and was
gliding westward when, from the heart's couch of a moss rose,
there came the eldest daughter of faeryland, probably the self-same
Jannet's daughter, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I have come from whence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace with white sceptre wafting to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooths the wide bosom of the Elysian world,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">and who, upon being informed that I was desirous of swearing
allegiance to her sweet mother, said that she would bring intelligence
whether I might be admitted to her pretty vassalage; she
then bade her attendants bring her car, which was a leaf of a favourite
hyacinth, drawn by two lady-birds who were guided by reins of
gossamer; the mellow horn of the herald bee summoned her
attendants, who, to the number of twenty, obeyed the call; and
taking the coronets from off their brows, made low obeisance to their
young princess, which she pleasingly acknowledged. Then they
each captured a sphere of thistle-down, and seating themselves
thereon, followed their princess; who, attended by her guards, each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
armed with a maiden's eye-lash, journeyed onwards towards the realms
of enchanted ground. I should think that not many minutes elapsed
when the cavalcade returned, and the charter written upon the leaf
of a 'forget-me-not,' with the gold from a butterfly's wing, was
placed into my hand by 'a fay,' with injunctions not to divulge the
secrets of the order. I would have promised but awoke from this
pleasant dream."</p>

<p>We will now read Montagu's description of the Fairy Janet,
and a fairy coming to him at sundown when adapted by Charlotte
Bront&euml; in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

<p>Ad&egrave;le asks Rochester whether she is to go to school without
her governess, Jane Eyre:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Yes," he replied; ... "for I am to take mademoiselle to the moon,
and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the
volcano tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me."</p>

<p>"... But you can't get her there...."</p>

<p>"Ad&egrave;le ... late one evening ... I sat down to rest me on a
stile ... when something came up the path.... Our speechless
colloquy was to this effect&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said.... It told me of the
alabaster cave and silver vale.... I said I should like to go....
'Oh,' returned the fairy.... 'Here is a talisman which will remove
all difficulties' and she held out a pretty gold ring...."</p>

<p>"But what has mademoiselle [Jane Eyre] to do with it? I don't
care for the fairy...."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle [Jane Eyre] is a fairy," he said, whispering
mysteriously.</p></div>

<p>But Ad&egrave;le assures him she made no account of his "<i>contes de
f&eacute;e</i>."</p>

<p>For the present it is enough to know that in the main and
ostensibly the Fairy Janet Eyre was Charlotte Bront&euml;'s adaptation of
Montagu's Fairy Janet, the queen-elf of the Malhamdale fairies,
said to frequent the enchanted land round the source of the
Aire.</p>

<p>The fairy idea, Charlotte discovered, served well to give a
certain gallantry to Rochester's bestowing of epithets. These the
reader may have interest in finding in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. For instance,
when Jane, returning from her visit to a dead relative, informs
Rochester, he says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A true <i>Janian</i> reply! [italics mine]. Good angels be my guard!
She comes from the other world&mdash;from the abode of people who are
dead, and tells me so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming!
If I dared, I'd touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!&mdash;but
I'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue <i>ignis-fatuus</i> light in the
marsh."</p></div>

<p>A few lines lower Rochester asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Tell me, now, fairy as you are&mdash;can't you give a charm?"</p></div>

<p class="noidt">And then farther down:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Pass, Janet: go up home and stay your weary little wandering feet
at a friend's threshold."</p></div>

<p>When Rochester's bed is in flames, and he awakes to find Janet
has thrown water upon it, he demands:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?"</p></div>

<p>And so I might continue. It is observable Charlotte Bront&euml;
never allows Rochester to call Jane Eyre "Janet" and "fairy" in the
same breath. She permits the use of Janet, however, when the fairy
notion is concealed, as when Rochester says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Just put your hand in mine, Janet, that I may have the evidence of
touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me."</p></div>

<p class="noidt">Certain it is that in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s inmost heart her autobiographical
self was called Janet Aire.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;'s conceptions, when she let her imagination
have play and forgot the world of readers were, like Jane Eyre's
thoughts, "elfish." See the fairy tale, <i>The Adventures of Ernest
Alembert</i> (attributed by Charlotte Bront&euml; to her pen in her fifteenth
year). It has been remarked this story is not in the handwriting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Charlotte Bront&euml; affected at this period, and that the manuscript has
not Charlotte's customary title-page.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In view of the evidence of
<i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>, it is of interest to make a comparison
between <i>Alembert</i> and Montagu's <i>Gleanings in Craven</i>, published
eight years later than the date Charlotte Bront&euml; ascribed to its completion.
The association of the family of Lambert with hypothetical
high treason and with being extinct; with the Malham country as
described by Montagu&mdash;the references, so frequent in his pages, to
the awe inspired by the wildness of the scenery, to the underground
torrent, the contrasting range of crags, the lake, the fairy cave, the
fairy and the admittance into faerydom; to "the mellow hum of the
bee," etc., are interesting in the extreme, seeing by aid of Montagu
that Malham as presented by him became Gimmerton of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>. Whether "coincidence" has to do with this matter of
<i>Alembert</i> and Montagu, or Charlotte Bront&euml; has for some reason
ante-dated <i>Alembert</i>, I leave to the reader to decide.</p>

<p>I have often wondered why no one has ever observed before that
the hand which wrote <i>The Adventures of Ernest Alembert</i> must
assuredly have written every line of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. We may
well understand why Charlotte Bront&euml; in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> wrote
of Catherine Linton that "the mentioning the Fairy Cave quite
turned her head" with interest. And that the original of the Fairy
Cave in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> was the Fairy Cave of Malhamdale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Montagu mentions at such length in his Malham letter, the use of
the names Linton and Airton in the connection irrefutably proves
without other appeal: Hareton&mdash;that variant of Aire, cannot be associated
with Derbyshire like "Eyre"; and despite the use of "Eyre,"
Aire was the name in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s mind, just as "Airton" was
when she wrote "Hareton."</p>

<p>Both the "boy-guide" and "Gimmerton's mist" were obviously
suggested to Charlotte Bront&euml; for <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by Montagu,
the original, as I have shown, of Lockwood:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>Montagu's frequent references to the mountainous character of
the Malham country were doubtless responsible for Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
choice of the word "heights" used in her title. Why the name of
Gimmer, from "gimmer" a female sheep, and signifying with "ton"
the place of sheep, was chosen by her for Gimmerton, is clear
when we read the etymology Montagu gives of Skipton. He
mentions Skibden and Skipton, proceeding to explain that "Skipton,
or Sceptown (from the Saxon word 'scep,' a sheep)" meant "the town
of sheep"; and Montagu tells us a native spoke of the village as
"the town of Malham." Hence we perceive why Charlotte Bront&euml;
coined "Gimmerton," the village of sheep, and "Gimmerden," the
valley of sheep, for Malham and Malhamdale with the source of the
Aire, the Fairy Cave, the Sough, the adjacent crags, the heights,
the glens, the rising mists, the Methodist chapel and kirk in the
lonely vale, when in the light of all the foregoing we read in
Montagu's work that:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here [at Malham] there is an annual fair held on the 15th of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
October, appropriated entirely for the sale of sheep.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> I am within
the limit of fact when I say that upwards of one hundred thousand
[sheep] have been shown at one time. [Joseph takes cattle to
"Gimmerton Fair," of course not in October.] The houses are
mostly built of limestone, and covered with grit slates, and irregularly
situated at the base of a range of steep mountains"&mdash;"the Heights."</p>

<p>Malham he describes as "a small township, divided into east and
west portions by a rapid stream"&mdash;"the beck down Gimmerton."
"There is a Methodist chapel at Malham," he states, and says that
the old church of Kirkby-Malham "is in the very bosom of the vale of
Malham." Thus Gimmerton Kirk, in the lonely valley of Gimmerton,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
was Charlotte Bront&euml;'s name in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> for the kirk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
by Malham, in the lonely vale of Malham. This insight into the
origin of the name of "kirk" for a Yorkshire church excuses what,
without it, would have been an anachronistic misnomer. As for the
Nonconformists' place of worship, Dean is made to remark:&mdash;"They
call the Methodists' or Baptists' place&mdash;I can't say which it
is at Gimmerton&mdash;a chapel."</p>

<p>In the light of the foregoing evidence it is impossible to ignore
the reference Montagu makes to "the sinks," where the water from
Malham Tarn sinks underground for a considerable distance.
Whether Charlotte Bront&euml; thought this would produce a quag in the
neighbourhood I cannot tell; but if she has used the word "sough"
(pronounced <i>suff</i>) in its ordinary acceptance in Yorkshire, she
originally meant "a subterranean passage or tunnel, draining water
as from a sink," if I may quote a definition in Dr. Joseph Wright's
<i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>. There is every sign in her writings of a
loose, composite adaptation of Montagu's topography, etc., yet
Charlotte Bront&euml; was ever jealous of associations, and under a guise
or not she frequently preserved carefully recognizable characteristics
necessary to locality and to personality; and we see Montagu had
associated a sough with Malham. We have mention of Gimmerton
Sough in Chapter III. of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and in Chapter X.:&mdash;"... the
valley of Gimmerton, with a long list of mist winding
nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the chapel ... the
sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the
bend of the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery
vapour." And we have read what Montagu says about the mists of
Malham.</p>

<p>The influence of Montagu's descriptions of this wild locality is
likewise observable in the scenery and the background of <i>Jane Eyre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
as I mentioned in the article "The Key to <i>Jane Eyre</i>" I wrote in
<i>The Saturday Review</i>. The yews and evergreens, mentioned by
Montagu in connection with Malham, and introduced by Charlotte
Bront&euml;, with other trees of the fir-tribe, in descriptions of Morton in
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chap. XXX., etc., and in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, are not
common to Haworth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE RIVERS OR BRONT&Euml; FAMILY IN "JANE EYRE."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Charlotte Bront&euml;</span>, while she often portrayed the main characters of
her stories from people in her own life, was quite at home with them
in whatsoever condition or surroundings she placed them.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> She
loved the memory of Tabitha Aykroyd&mdash;that faithful servant, companion,
and friend; hated the vices of her brother Branwell Bront&euml;,
and was obsessed by thoughts of M. H&eacute;ger, her Brussels friend. So
she placed the good old housekeeper of the parsonage&mdash;under an
ecclesiastical cognomen truly&mdash;as Mrs. Dean at Wuthering Heights;
set up her brother Branwell on the same premises as Hindley
Earnshaw, and put her Brussels friend in the position of master of
that abode.</p>

<p>In <i>Jane Eyre</i> Tabitha Aykroyd is Bessie of Mrs. Reed's household,
and Hannah of the Rivers family; Branwell is among better
surroundings as John Reed, and M. H&eacute;ger is portrayed more
proportionately as the master of Thornfield; while in the same work
Charlotte Bront&euml; portrays her own sister Maria Bront&euml;, and makes
her say she is a native of Northumberland and describe the scenery
round her birthplace there!</p>

<p>In <i>Shirley</i> Charlotte admits to having placed Emily Bront&euml; as
"Shirley Keeldar," surrounded by the environment of a wealthy
woman&mdash;a landed proprietress in the Dewsbury neighbourhood; and
she gives us phases of M. H&eacute;ger as a resident of Yorkshire, in the
two Moores.</p>

<p><i>Villette</i> contains in Dr. John, towards the close, a portrait of the
Rev. Mr. Nicholls, who became her husband, as a resident of the
foreign town Villette&mdash;for I find the character Dr. John was a portrait
not wholly drawn, as is supposed, from Mr. Smith of Messrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Smith &amp; Elder, the Bront&euml; publishers; and glimpses of Mr. Thackeray
as a Villette lecturer appear in a flitting usurpation of M. H&eacute;ger's
rights as the original of M. Paul.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;'s thus placing given characters against any
background is doubtless responsible for the fact that when I wrote
the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> article, "The Lifting of the Bront&euml; Veil: A
New Study of the Bront&euml; Family," in March, 1907, nigh on sixty
years of readers of the Bront&euml; works had failed to recognize Charlotte
Bront&euml; had portrayed in <i>Jane Eyre</i> not only herself and her sister,
Maria Bront&euml;, as was commonly known, but also her brother,
Branwell Bront&euml;; her Aunt Branwell; her cousin, Eliza Branwell;
her sister, Elizabeth Bront&euml;; her sister, Emily Bront&euml;; her sister,
Anne Bront&euml;; her father, the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;; and also Tabitha
Aykroyd, the Bront&euml; servant. Perhaps it was because readers believed
Morton was Hathersage, Derbyshire, that a suspicion of the
Rivers family being the Bront&euml; family at Haworth never had been
entertained.</p>

<p>I found, however, that all the above-mentioned members of the
Bront&euml; family were placed in <i>Jane Eyre</i> under a "Rivers" surname;
and proceeding into the inquiry as to their identity, I perceived this
discovery of the Bront&euml; family in <i>Jane Eyre</i> numbered with the more
important of my Bront&euml; discoveries, and that despite her purposed
and reasonable cross-scents&mdash;the spired church, the mention of knife-grinders,
and the hinting at the proximity of Sheffield, all so necessary
in her day to permit the portrayal of phases of the life at Haworth
Parsonage&mdash;Morton to Charlotte Bront&euml; was in the main Haworth.
What importance would attach to a discovery of an unknown portrait
group of his family deliberately painted from life by an old master!
Such is the importance of this discovery of the Bront&euml; family drawn
by the pen of Charlotte Bront&euml; herself in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Currer Bell
portrayed with unvarying truth; and with cunning artistry she
brought forward in her literary legacy to the English novel the sure
characteristics&mdash;the very soul, the shallowness, the pretty affectionateness,
the cooing "dove-like voice," the "blue steel glance,"
of those she had watched and loved and feared.</p>

<p>Now, in the selection of a Christian name for the heroine Jane
Eyre, in whom she had portrayed herself, there was every reason why
Charlotte Bront&euml; would be unlikely to adopt the second name of her
sister, Emily Jane. We have seen, however, that Charlotte Bront&euml;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
had been led by Montagu's mention of the Fairy Jannet, or Janet,
poetically to make her heroine a Fairy Janet. This evidence shows,
therefore, that "Jane" was really only secondary. The Fairy Cave
which this fairy was supposed to frequent is near Malham or
Gimmerton, and, as I have said, the Fairy Janet is termed "the
queen of the Malhamdale elves that frequent the enchanted land
round the source of the Aire." Montagu mentions the fact that the
river Ayre takes its rise at Malham&mdash;at Malham Tarn, and hence
Charlotte Bront&euml; seems to have named her heroine originally Janet
Aire. Obvious it is she would be led, naturally, to use later some
variant of Aire or Ayre; and the fact that she visited in the summer
of 1845 (evidence shows she had read Montagu at the time)<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> her
friend Miss Nussey, then at Hathersage in Derbyshire, where Eyre
is a common name, would suggest she was led to adopt this variant
through her visit there. We already have seen Charlotte Bront&euml;
used the variant of "Hare" for "Air" in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> for the
boy Hareton from Montagu's boy-guide, Robert Airton. And that
she wished in <i>Jane Eyre</i> to break through the confines of the variant
she had chosen for Aire, and give open expression to her original
and poetic idea, is seen plainly enough where Ad&egrave;le asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And Mademoiselle&mdash;what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Eyre&mdash;Jane Eyre."</p>

<p>"Aire? bah, I cannot say it."</p></div>

<p>Having made this interesting discovery, I further found that,
not satisfied with appropriating for herself the "stream" surname,
she placed such a surname upon those who were related to her and
whom she had portrayed in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. So she used Burns from
"burn," a stream spelt with an "s," for Maria Bront&euml;; Rivers,
from a river also spelt with an "s," for Emily Bront&euml;, Anne Bront&euml;,
and the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;, with Tabitha Aykroyd in attendance
as Hannah; Reed, from the river of that name for Charlotte's
Aunt Branwell, her cousin Eliza Branwell, and her brother, Branwell
Bront&euml;; Severn, from the river of that name for her sister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Elizabeth Bront&euml;&mdash;just as she used Aire from the river of that
name for herself, as Janet Aire.</p>

<p>A reference to Mrs. Gaskell's Bront&euml; <i>Life</i> were sufficient to
establish the identifications, when I say that by Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
Method II. (the alteration of the age of a character portrayed) the
Rev. Patrick Bront&euml; is represented as a young man in the Rev. St.
John Eyre Rivers&mdash;certainly a very necessary obfuscation, for it is to
be seen the home at Morton gives a most enlightening insight into
the life at the Haworth Parsonage. A death is supposed to have
occurred in the Rivers family; and when it is remembered Thornfield
to Charlotte Bront&euml; represented the H&eacute;gers' establishment at
Brussels, and that she left Brussels the first time on account of the
death of her aunt, Miss Elizabeth Branwell who, after being the
female head of the parsonage some years, died there in the close of
1842, we may know for whom the Rivers family were really in
mourning. Charlotte Bront&euml; tells us that, looking through the
window of Moor House&mdash;Haworth Parsonage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I could see ... an elderly woman [Tabitha Aykroyd&mdash;the Mrs. Dean
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>], somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
like all about her, ... knitting a stocking.... Two young, graceful
women [Emily and Anne Bront&euml;]&mdash;ladies in every point&mdash;sat, one in a
low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning,
... which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a
large old ... dog [Emily had a favourite dog] rested his massive head
on the knee of one girl&mdash;in the lap of the other was cushioned a black
cat. A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants [but
they were ever fond of it]. Who were they? They could not be the
daughters of the elderly person at the table [Tabitha]; for she looked
like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation. I had nowhere
seen such faces as theirs; and yet, as I gazed on them I seemed intimate
with every lineament. I cannot call them handsome&mdash;they were too
pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book they looked
thoughtful almost to severity. A stand between them supported a second
candle and two great volumes to which they frequently referred;
comparing them ... with the smaller books they held in their hands
like people consulting a dictionary to aid ... in the task of translation.
This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the
fire-lit apartment a picture.</p>

<p>"Listen, Diana [Emily Bront&euml;]", said one of the absorbed students,
... and in a low voice she read ... in German.... The other girl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated, while she gazed
at the fire, a line.... "Good!" ... she exclaimed, while her dark and
deep eyes sparkled, ... "I like it!"</p>

<p>"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old
woman [Tabitha, using her Haworth Yorkshire dialect], and being told
there is:&mdash;"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t'one
t'other: and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I
guess?"</p>

<p>"... Not all&mdash;for we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.
We don't speak German...."</p>

<p>"And what good does it do you?"</p>

<p>"We mean to teach it some time&mdash;or at least the elements, as they
say; and then we shall get more money than we do now."</p>

<p>"Varry like; but give ower studying: ye've done enough for to-night."</p>

<p>"I think we have.... I wonder when St. John [the Rev. Patrick
Bront&euml;] will come home."</p>

<p>"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten" (looking at a little
gold watch she drew from her girdle). "It rains fast. Hannah, will you
have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"</p></div>

<p>Charlotte seems to have portrayed particularly those happy
months at home in 1842, when, after the death of their aunt, all
three sisters were together and their brother Branwell was away. It
is Anne Bront&euml; who, as Mary Rivers, consults her watch. For the
circumstances in which she acquired this gold watch see the will of
Miss Elizabeth Branwell, her aunt.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The woman [Tabitha] rose: she opened a door, ... soon I heard
her stir the fire in an inner room. She presently came back: "Ah
childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond room now: it
looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."</p></div>

<p>The Bront&euml; sisters were "always children in the eyes of
Tabitha." Continuing her description of her sisters, Charlotte as
Jane says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Both were fair complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed
faces full of distinction and intelligence. One [Emily Bront&euml;] to be sure
had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in
their style of wearing it: Mary's [Anne Bront&euml;'s] pale brown locks were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
parted and braided smooth; Diana's [Emily Bront&euml;'s] duskier tresses
covered her neck with thick curls.... [She] had a voice toned to my
ear, like the cooing of a dove. She possessed eyes whose gaze I
delighted to encounter. Her whole face seemed to me full of charm,
Mary's [Anne Bront&euml;'s] countenance was equally intelligent&mdash;her features
equally pretty; but her expression was more reserved; and her
manner, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked and spoke with a
certain authority [it was Emily Bront&euml;'s manner]: she had a will....
It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported
like hers; and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted,
to an active will.</p></div>

<p>The following is the portrait of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s father (Method
II., the altering the age of the character portrayed) as her
imagination pictured him to have been in his young days. St. John's
was the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;'s college at Cambridge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. St. John ... had he been a statue instead of a man ... could
not have been easier. He was ... tall, slender; his face riveted the
eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline; quite a straight
classic nose, quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom indeed
an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.... His
eyes were large and blue, ... his high forehead, colourless as ivory,
was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.... He ...
scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle ... or even of a placid
nature; ... there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow,
which ... indicated elements within either restless, or hard or eager.</p></div>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;'s references herewith, and in other instances, to
the passionate nature of her father are interesting reading, especially
in view of the fact that this point has been the subject of controversy.
To return to <i>Jane Eyre</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Rivers [Mr. Bront&euml;] now closed his book, approached the table,
and, as he took a seat, fixed his pictorial-looking eyes full upon me.
There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness
in his gaze now which told that intention ... had hitherto kept
it averted ... St. John's eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in
a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He seemed to use them rather
as instruments to search other people's thoughts, than as agents to
reveal his own: the which combination of keenness and reserve was
considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell states that even in his old age Mr. Bront&euml;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> was a
tall and a striking-looking man, with a nobly shaped head and erect
carriage, and that in youth he must have been unusually handsome.
And to use the words of Hannah, "Mr. St. John when he grew up
would go to college and be a parson." Continuing, Mrs. Gaskell
further says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The course of his life shows a powerful and remarkable character,
originating and pursuing a purpose in a resolute and independent manner&mdash;separating
himself from his family. There was no trace of his Irish
origin in his speech; he never could have shown his Celtic origin in the
straight Greek lines and long oval of his face.</p></div>

<p>Another writer accentuating this says Mr. Bront&euml; was "proud of
his Greek profile," and we have now seen that Charlotte Bront&euml; herself
says his (St. John's) face was "like a Greek face, pure in outline."
Mr. Bront&euml; had also "fine blue eyes," like Mr. St. John. "His (Mr.
Bront&euml;'s) passionate nature was compressed down with stoicism, but
it was there, notwithstanding all his philosophic calm and dignity of
demeanour, though he did not speak when displeased. He was an
active walker, stretching away over the moors for many miles. He
dined alone, and did not require companionship."</p>

<p>Which is, of course, all consonant with what we read of St. John
Eyre Rivers. Charlotte Bront&euml; continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As to Mr. St. John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally ...
between me and ... [my] sisters did not extend to him. One reason of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the distance ... observed between us was, that he was comparatively
seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to
visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat
and ... go out on his mission of love and duty.... But, besides his
frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with him: he
seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even a brooding nature.
Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, he yet
did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content which
should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist.
Often of an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk
and papers before him, he would cease reading or writing, rest his chin
on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought;
but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent
dilation of his eye.</p>

<p>I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight
it was to his [my] sisters. He once expressed, and but once in my
hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn
affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but
there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which
the sentiment was manifested; and never did he roam the moors for
the sake of their soothing silence&mdash;never to seek out or dwell upon the
thousand peaceful delights they could yield.</p>

<p>Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an
opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre when
I heard him preach in his own church.... I wish I could describe that
sermon; but it is past my power. I cannot even render faithfully the
effect it produced on me.</p>

<p>It began calm, and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went,
it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
This grew to force&mdash;compressed, condensed, controlled.... Throughout
there was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness;
stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines&mdash;election, predestination, reprobation&mdash;were
frequent.... It seemed to me ... that the eloquence to
which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid
dregs of disappointment&mdash;where moved troubling impulses of insatiable
yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John Rivers, pure-lived,
conscientious, zealous as he was&mdash;had not yet found that peace of
God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it ...
than had I: with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol
and lost elysium.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Charlotte Bront&euml;," says Miss Laura C. Holloway, "early
exhibited antagonistic feelings towards the Calvinistic views of her
father." And so I might continue at great length. Excluding the
love passages necessary to "story" and the missionary suggestions
for which it seems that Brussels priest whom I may call Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s F&eacute;nelon was originally responsible, the portrayal of the
Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;, like that of Charlotte's sisters, is absolutely true
to prototype and fact.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> We discover that at heart Charlotte Bront&euml;
loved her father, hence she honoured him&mdash;the head of the "Rivers"
family&mdash;by giving him the final word in her autobiography, speaking
of him as he appeared to her: an old man whose days were drawing
to a close. Jane relates of Morton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Near the churchyard, and in the middle of the garden, stood a well-built
though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">In Charlotte Bront&euml;'s mind this was Haworth Parsonage; but it is
clear that, despite the church "spire" and other efforts at obfuscation,
she did not dare to portray her sisters and father in the parsonage.
Thus she placed the family in another house. And now we will
have another glimpse of Tabitha Aykroyd, this time as "Hannah,"
speaking her Haworth Yorkshire dialect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Have you been with the family long?"</p>

<p>"I've lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.... I thowt
more o' th' childer nor of mysel'.... They've like nobody to tak' care on
'em but me ... I'm like to look sharpish."</p>

<p>Hannah was evidently fond of talking [see my chapter on Tabitha
Aykroyd]. While I picked the fruit and she made the paste for the pies,
she proceeded to give me sundry details about ... her deceased ...
mistress, and "the childer," as she called the young people.... There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked
learning, all three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had
always been "of a mak" of their own [had individual character]. They
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now
to stay a few weeks on account of their father's [aunt's] death: but they
did so like Marsh End and Morton [Haworth] and all these moors and
hills about. They had been in ... many grand towns, but they always
said there was no place like home; and then they were so agreeable
with each other&mdash;never fell out nor "threaped" [asserted beyond the
argumentative point]. She did not know where there was such a family
for being united.</p></div>

<p>Emily Bront&euml; as Diana says it is "a privilege we exercise in our
home to prepare our own meals when ... so inclined, or when
Hannah [Tabby] is baking, brewing, washing or ironing," which of
course was true at Haworth Parsonage. To give yet another
description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Rivers [Bront&euml;s] clung to the purple moors behind and around
their dwelling with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend
the feeling, and share both its strength and truth. I saw the
fascination of the locality, ... my eye feasted on the outline of swell
and sweep.... The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the
halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset ... developed for me ...
the same attraction as for them&mdash;wound round my faculties the same
spell that entranced theirs.</p></div>

<p>Then follow pictures of the life at Haworth Parsonage, which tell
us how Charlotte Bront&euml; adored her sisters; and with the modesty
of true genius she places herself at their feet, as it were. We have a
sketch of Tabitha Aykroyd ironing Aunt Branwell's lace frills and
crimping her nightcap borders in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chapter I., wherein
both figure as Bessie and Aunt Reed. Years ago it came to be
thought the original of Jane Eyre's Aunt Reed was Miss Branwell, the
aunt of the Bront&euml; children, though one writer identified her with a
certain Mrs. Sidgwick whose son threw a book at Miss Bront&euml; in her
governess days, because "the son of Mrs. Reed" threw a Bible at
Jane Eyre. The fact the rainy-day narrations in <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> establish, that Charlotte Bront&euml; associated
a "volume-hurling" incident with her childhood and Branwell
Bront&euml;'s "tyranny," disposed finally of the Sidgwick identifications.
John Reed we have now seen was, like Hindley Earnshaw, Catherine's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
brother, drawn by Charlotte Bront&euml; from her brother Branwell
Bront&euml;. Always she wrote of him vindictively, and with a retributive
justice, her strong characteristic. At about the period when Currer
Bell was penning <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> Branwell
was a source of considerable distress to her. He was disgraced;
his habits were the reverse of temperate, and it was daily feared that
in a fit of delirium he might make an attempt upon his own life.
Indeed Charlotte Bront&euml; palpably writes of Branwell Bront&euml; and
those miserable associations which brought trouble upon Mrs.
Gaskell's first edition of the Bront&euml; <i>Life</i>, in <i>The Professor</i>,
Chapter XX., where she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Limited as had yet been my experience of life, I had once had the
opportunity of contemplating, near at hand, an example of the results
produced by a course of ... domestic treachery.... I saw it bare and
real, and it was very loathsome. I saw a mind degraded ... by the
habit of perfidious deception, and a body depraved by the infectious
influence of the vice-polluted soul. I had suffered much from the forced
and prolonged view of this spectacle.</p></div>

<p>Charlotte's letters also show she was ashamed of and losing
patience with him. John Reed is spoken of as "a dissipated young
man; they will never make much of him, I think.... Some people
call him a fine-looking young man; but he has such thick lips."
For obfuscation's sake he is "tall," and Mrs. Gaskell in speaking of
Branwell's profile says:&mdash;"There are coarse lines about the mouth,
and the lips, though handsome in shape, are loose and thick,
indicating self-indulgence." Aunt Reed exclaims at the last of her
favourite:&mdash;"John is sunken and degraded, his look is frightful&mdash;I
feel ashamed for him when I see him." It was near the time that
Aunt Branwell died at Haworth there was this decided degradation
of her favourite nephew Branwell. For story purposes Charlotte
Bront&euml; makes her aunt a married woman in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and places
her nephew Branwell and her niece Eliza Branwell in the relation of
children to her as John and Eliza Reed&mdash;Georgiana is no doubt a
Bront&euml; relative of whom we have not heard, and Charlotte thought
vain. The fact that in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chapter XXI., her name is
mentioned in connection with "a title," would show Currer Bell
early apportioned her a place in the book by reason of Montagu's
reference to a Lady Georgiana.</p>

<p>A child, sympathetic and intensely emotional, Charlotte Bront&euml;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
evidently, felt injustices with an acuteness not easy to understand
without reading her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> by aid
of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>. It would be like Maria Bront&euml;
to protest with her younger sister on her holding resentment against
Aunt Branwell; and with the inference that she herself had endured
her harshness, she says as Helen Burns:&mdash;"What a singularly deep
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart! No
ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would it not be
happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate
emotions it excited?"</p>

<p>Of Eliza Reed (Cousin Eliza Branwell), as seen by Jane at the
death of Aunt Reed, we are told: "she was now very thin, and there
was something ascetic in her look." She wore "a nun-like ornament
of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was
Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in
that elongated and colourless visage." In 1840 Charlotte Bront&euml;
wrote of her "Cousin Eliza Branwell" that she spoke of nothing
but botany, her own conversion, Low Church, Evangelical clergy,
and the Millennium.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> And thus in <i>Jane Eyre</i> we read of Cousin
Eliza Reed, by way of emphasis on this side of her character:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Eliza ... had no time to talk, ... yet it was difficult to say what
she did.... Three times a day she studied a little book which I found
... was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great
attraction of that volume, and she said 'the Rubric.' Three hours she
gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth;
... she informed me it was ... for the altar of a new church....
Two hours she devoted to ... working by herself in the kitchen garden.
[Cousin Eliza's parterre is also referred to in Chapter IV. of <i>Jane Eyre</i>.]
Eliza [attended] a saint's-day service at ... church&mdash;for in matters of
religion she was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the
punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or
foul she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days
as there were prayers. And by way of climax, Jane Eyre tells us that
Cousin Eliza says:&mdash;"I shall devote myself ... to the examination of
the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of the workings of
their system; if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the one best
calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order, I shall
embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The river Reed, I may remark, has its rise close to the Cheviot
Hills, within about five miles of the source of the Keeldar Burn,
which name Charlotte Bront&euml; used later in <i>Shirley</i> for the surname
of Shirley Keeldar who, the world knows, is really Emily Bront&euml;.
To quote a ballad of Leyden,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The heath-bell blows where Keeldar flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Tyne the primrose pale."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">The Reed has a Rochester near, which doubtless provided a name
for Charlotte's hero.</p>

<p>Having now the key to this method of Charlotte Bront&euml;, we also
discover portrayed in <i>Jane Eyre</i> an utterly neglected sister of Currer
Bell in Julia Severn, called after a river. Remembering that Emily
Bront&euml; would be younger than Charlotte, we perceive Julia must
mean Elizabeth Bront&euml;, born, like Emily, in July. We almost had
forgotten this sister was at the Clergy Daughters' School. One of
two things was responsible, it seems, for the choice of "Julia": either
her natal month or her going to the above school in July. Elizabeth
Bront&euml;, the second sister of Charlotte Bront&euml;, was born at Hartshead,
near Dewsbury.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Miss Temple," cries Mr. Brocklehurst, "... what&mdash;<i>what</i> is that
girl with curled hair&mdash;red hair, ma'am, curled&mdash;curled all over?"</p>

<p>"It is Julia Severn," replies Miss Temple quietly, ... "Julia's hair
curls naturally."</p></div>

<p>Thus from this discovery the world learns for the first time that
Diana Rivers represents Emily Bront&euml;, afterwards Shirley Keeldar;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Mary Rivers, Annie or Anne Bront&euml;; St. John Eyre Rivers, the
Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;; and the elderly Hannah, the old, dialect-speaking
Tabitha Aykroyd&mdash;the original of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Mrs.
Dean and Bessie; that Aunt Reed represents Aunt Branwell;
Cousin Eliza Reed, Cousin Eliza Branwell; John Reed, Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s brother Branwell; and Julia Severn, her sister Elizabeth
Bront&euml;, all of whom but for <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i> would
have remained for ever hidden and unrecognized in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>I have refrained from extending this volume with full extracts
from the Bront&euml; books, once having indicated the place and nature of
my references. I must emphasize, however, that in dealing with the
Rivers family Charlotte Bront&euml; gives most appealing portrayals of the
various phases of the life at Haworth Parsonage:&mdash;The studying,
the painting,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the minor interesting domestic incidents dear to her
memory, the parting of the Bront&euml; sisters with St. John (Mr. Bront&euml;),
the "house-cleaning"&mdash;so very "Yorkshire"!&mdash;the preparations
for Christmas, the return home of the Bront&euml; girls, and many other
facts and associations that render <i>Jane Eyre</i> in the light of <i>The Key
to the Bront&euml; Works</i> the surpassing of all Bront&euml; biographies. Presented
for posterity by her own sure hand, Charlotte Bront&euml;'s picture
is bright and exhilarating; and as we glance uneasily again to Mrs.
Gaskell's sombre portrayal, we on a sudden remember that biographer
wrote in the shadow of death. But it is with life we have to do.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE YORKSHIRE ELEMENT IN CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;'S
HUNSDEN OF "THE PROFESSOR"; HEATHCLIFFE OF "WUTHERING
HEIGHTS"; ROCHESTER OF "JANE EYRE"; AND YORKE
OF "SHIRLEY."</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">M. H&eacute;ger</span>, Miss Bront&euml;'s Brussels friend, by the showing of all
evidence was essentially the original of her leading male characters.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
M. Sue's <i>Miss Mary</i> and its "Manuscript of Mdlle. Lagrange,"
which I present farther on, are sufficient testimony that M. H&eacute;ger
was the original of the inner Heathcliffe and Rochester, and
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s other chief male characters. An inquiry, therefore,
is at once required as to the significance of Mrs. Gaskell's
statement that she suspected Charlotte Bront&euml; drew from the sons
of the Taylor family<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> "all that was of truth in the characters of the
heroes of her first two works." That the Yorkshire element of her
heroes was provided by a living model or models from one family, is
proved by a consistency of the characterization in this regard. I
find, truly enough, that male members of the Taylor family were
indeed the originals to which she referred in the composition of a
Yorkshire-H&eacute;ger.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The Taylors, of the Red House, Gomersall,
(obviously the Briarmains of the Yorkes), and of Hunsworth, were
mill-owner friends, and Independents, with whom Charlotte Bront&euml;
visited. In <i>Shirley</i> Miss Bront&euml; ostensibly portrayed Mr. Taylor and
his two daughters, her friends Mary and Martha, as Mr. Yorke and
Rose and Jessie. Mary and Martha Taylor were at school with
Charlotte at Roe Head, near Dewsbury and Huddersfield. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
were also at Brussels with Charlotte, though not at the H&eacute;gers'.
Martha was taken ill and died at Brussels; a touching reference to
her death is made where she is portrayed as Jessie Yorke, in <i>Shirley</i>,
Chapter XXIII. Mary Taylor (Rose Yorke) was in New Zealand
when Charlotte Bront&euml; died. Her fondness for travel is mentioned
in the <i>Shirley</i> chapter named. The male members of this family
were thought by Currer Bell most characteristic Yorkshire folk,
hence the name of Yorke. I mention Yorke Hunsden as one of the
Yorkshire-H&eacute;gers of Miss Bront&euml;'s method of dual portraiture. I
believe this important character in <i>The Professor</i> will be found, like
his fellows, to be entirely a Taylor-H&eacute;ger. The name for Hunsden
was apparently dictated by the Taylors' connection with Hunsworth,
and it may be noted his Christian name of Yorke came to be later
the surname of Mr. Taylor as portrayed in <i>Shirley</i>.</p>

<p>But the H&eacute;ger element was always superior to the Yorkshire
element in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s heroes. The latter might provide
useful and necessary external characteristics, but the "intensitives"
were the lines she drew from her model, M. H&eacute;ger. Of him as
M. Pelet in <i>The Professor</i>, she writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>His face was pale, his cheeks were sunk, and his eyes hollow; his
features ... had a French turn, ... the degree of harshness softened
by ... a melancholy, almost suffering expression of countenance; his
physiognomy was <i>fine et spirituelle</i>.</p></div>

<p>This "melancholy almost suffering expression of countenance"
she thus described was evidently once a marked characteristic of
M. H&eacute;ger's physiognomy. A reference to it occurs in M. Sue's
<i>Miss Mary</i>, in the French and "adapted" version, where we find
M. de Morville, whom I identify as a phase of M. H&eacute;ger, sitting in
a reverie:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... l'expression de l&eacute;g&egrave;re souffrance habituelle &agrave; sa physionomie,
d'ailleurs si ouverte, s'est compliqu&eacute;e d'une sorte de contrainte lorsqu'il
se trouve au milieu de sa famille. Seul, et ne subissant pas cette
contrainte ... M. de Morville semble profond&eacute;ment attrist&eacute;.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">Thus, of Yorke Hunsden in <i>The Professor</i>, we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>His general bearing intimated complete ... satisfaction, ... yet,
at times, an indescribable shade passed like an eclipse over his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
countenance, and seemed to me like the sign of a sudden and strong
inward doubt of himself, ... an energetic discontent, ... perhaps
... it might only be a bilious caprice.</p></div>

<p class="noidt">And again of Hunsden, in the same vein:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I discerned ... there would be contrasts between his inward and
outward man; contentions too.... Perhaps in these incompatibilities of
the "physique" with the "morale" lay the secret of that fitful gloom; he
<i>would</i> but <i>could</i> not, and the athletic mind scowled scorn on its more
fragile companion, ... his features ... character had set a stamp
upon ... expression re-cast them at her pleasure, and strange metamorphoses
she wrote, giving him now the mien of a morose bull, and
anon, that of an ... arch girl.</p></div>

<p>Regarding these facial metamorphoses Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote
similarly concerning M. H&eacute;ger.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>I remark that M. H&eacute;ger's harshness evidently had impressed
Charlotte Bront&euml; considerably at first, and thus reflects her thoughts
on this point in the introduction of the phases she gives of him in
her books. So we read of Yorke Hunsden, of Heathcliffe, and of
Rochester:&mdash;</p>

<p>We read of Rochester:&mdash;"The frown, the roughness of the
stranger set me at my ease"; and in <i>Villette</i>, we read of M. H&eacute;ger
as M. Paul:&mdash;"Once ... I held him harsh and strange, ... the
darkness, the manner displeased me. Now ... I preferred him
before all humanity," which explains why Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote of
Rochester:&mdash;"The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that
had startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice
dish," and explains why she admits to the piquancy in exploiting
the possibilities of Heathcliffe's startling harshness.</p>

<p>And again, as further evidence of the influence of M. H&eacute;ger over
her Yorkshire Hunsden, we find this character in the close of <i>The
Professor</i> implicated with a mysterious "Lucia," whom he would
have married but could not, which Lucia we discover to have meant
really the original of the Lucy Snowe of <i>Villette</i>&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml;
herself.</p>

<p>It is obvious that while Currer Bell, for "story" and other
purposes, made use of a composite method in presenting a portrait,
she drew from characters who possessed much in common: as with
the composite character of the Rev. Mr. Helstone, meant for her
father, a clergyman, but presenting also a phase of another clergyman,
the Rev. Hammond Roberson; and as with Dr. John Bretton,
a composite character drawn from the two Scotsmen, Mr. Smith
her publisher, and the Rev. A. B. Nicholls, who subsequently
became her husband. Doubtless, characteristics in the Taylors were
similar to some of M. H&eacute;ger's. Perhaps the fact that they spoke
French and sojourned on the Continent, accentuated to her these
characteristics. In a letter, Miss Bront&euml; described all the Taylors as
"Republicans." And so of Yorke Hunsden in <i>The Professor</i>, Chap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
XXIV., we read, "republican, lord-hater, as he was, Hunsden was
proud of his old &mdash;&mdash;shire blood ... and family standing." Thus, in
<i>Shirley</i>, Chap. IV., in which work that character appears stripped of
the H&eacute;ger element, as Mr. Yorke, we read of the latter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Kings and nobles and priests ... were to him an abomination....
The want of ... benevolence made him very impatient of ... all faults
which grated on his strong, shrewd nature: it left no check to his ...
sarcasm. As he was not merciful, he would sometimes wound ...
without ... caring how deep he thrust.... Mr. Yorke's family was the
first and oldest in the district.</p></div>

<p><i>Vi&acirc;</i> Yorke Hunsden of <i>The Professor</i> and Mr. Yorke of <i>Shirley</i>
the reader has returned to a character who typified more than any
other of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Yorkshire-H&eacute;ger portrayals the merciless,
strong and shrewd-natured Taylor&mdash;Heathcliffe of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.
But the Yorkshire element in Heathcliffe was a caricature and an
exaggeration for the purposes of the "cuckoo story," resulting from
the tale Montagu tells of a foundling; and the emphasis laid upon
his barbarity was largely a result, too, of the consideration I mention
in the chapters entitled "The Recoil," which consideration had to
do with the H&eacute;ger phase of Heathcliffe. The fact that evidence
shows Heathcliffe to have been, like Hunsden and Rochester, a
composite character drawn from a dual model&mdash;the Taylor-H&eacute;ger
model&mdash;traceable in origin absolutely to Charlotte Bront&euml;'s idiosyncratic
estimate of two male characters who are shown to have
seriously interested her, in itself sufficiently demonstrates her authorship
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and is indeed of great interest.</p>

<p>If reference be made to a letter written by Charlotte Bront&euml; in
1846, the year when she offered <i>Wuthering Heights</i> to a publisher, it
will be found she mentioned that one of the Taylors had&mdash;like
Heathcliffe&mdash;suffered in the teens of years from hypochondria, "a
most dreadful doom," Charlotte called it, and related she herself had
endured it for a year.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Having herself suffered thus, there was a temptation&mdash;at what
I elsewhere call the dark season of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s inner life, at
the season of the recoil&mdash;to present in her work <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
the Yorkshire-H&eacute;ger with the hypochondria of her Yorkshire model,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and let his demon be the original of her Catherine Earnshaw&mdash;be
herself. To this temptation Charlotte Bront&euml; gave no opposition,
much to her regret later. Herewith we have the origin of Heathcliffe's
miserable hypochondria and monomania&mdash;his digging for
Catherine in the grave till his spade scraped the coffin, in <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, Chap. XXIX., and his saying because his "preternatural
horror" always haunted, but never abided with him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"She showed herself, ... a devil to me! And, since then ... I've
been the sport of that intolerable torture! Infernal&mdash;keeping my nerves
at such a stretch that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long
ago have relaxed.... It racked me! I've groaned aloud.... It was
a strange way of killing! not by inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths,
... through eighteen years!" Mr. Heathcliffe paused, ... his hair
wet with perspiration, ... the brows not contracted, but raised next the
temples; diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting
a peculiar look of trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension
towards one absorbing subject.</p></div>

<p>In the light of the foregoing, therefore, we may understand
the truth of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s narration in <i>The Professor</i>, Chap.
XXIII.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My nerves ... jarred ... A horror of great darkness fell upon
me; I felt my chamber invaded by one I had known formerly, ... I
was ... a prey to hypochondria. She had been ... my guest ...
before ... for a year.... I had her to myself in secret; she lay
with me, she ate with me, showing me nooks in woods, hollows in hills,
where we could sit together, and where she could drop her drear veil
over me, and so hide sky and sun, grass and green tree; taking me
entirely to her death-cold bosom and holding me with arms of bone.
What tales she would tell me at such hours!... How she would
discourse to me of her own country&mdash;the grave.... I was glad when ...
I could ... sit ... freed from the dreadful tyranny of my demon.</p></div>

<p>Both by reason of Mrs. Gaskell's suspicion that she had drawn
from them in the portrayals of the heroes of her first books and by
reason of the undeniable evidence of her works, we must accept the
Taylors as the originals of most that was "Yorkshire" in Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s Yorke Hunsden, Heathcliffe, Rochester, and Yorke, understanding
the term in Currer Bell's implication of "independent,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
"hard," and "open-spoken." But M. H&eacute;ger contributed what
Charlotte Bront&euml; calls in Chap. XXVII. of <i>Villette</i>, in speaking of
him as M. Paul Emanuel&mdash;"that swart, sallow, southern darkness
which spoke his Spanish blood," and this gave colour to the
physiognomy of "the swart, sallow" Heathcliffe and Rochester.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In the succeeding chapters I deal more particularly with the
relation of Heathcliffe of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, to Rochester of <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, and I promise my readers to present therein most important
and sensational revelations.</p>

<h3>HEATHCLIFFE OF "WUTHERING HEIGHTS" AND ROCHESTER OF
"JANE EYRE" ONE AND THE SAME.</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Without</span> herewith further entering into the question as to the
original of the morose and harsh characters who were the heroes of
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s novels, I will at once show she had drawn from
the same model in both <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>. I
have given in the foregoing chapter the introduction of Lockwood
to Heathcliffe and that of Jane to Rochester side by side. Let us
also read the following:&mdash;</p>

<tr>
  <td class='tdl'>With a stubborn countenance
... Heathcliffe is a dark-skinned
gipsy in aspect, in dress
and manners a gentleman; ...
rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not
looking amiss with his negligence,
because he has an erect and
handsome figure; and rather
morose. Possibly some people
might suspect him of a degree
of under-bred pride; I have a
sympathetic cord within that
tells me it is nothing of the
sort: I know by instinct his
reserve springs from an aversion
to showy displays of feeling&mdash;to
manifestations of mutual kindliness.
He'll love and hate
equally under one cover, and
esteem it a species of impertinence
to be loved or hated
again. No, I am running on
too fast; I bestow my own
attributes over liberally on him.</td>
  <td class='tdl'>Most people would have
thought Mr. Rochester an ugly
man; yet there was an unconscious
pride in his port;
so much ease in his demeanour;
such a look of complete indifference
to his own appearance
... that ... one inevitably
shared the indifference, and
even in a blind sense put faith in
his confidence.... He was
proud, sardonic; ... in my
secret soul I knew his kindness
to me was balanced by unjust
severity to others. He was
moody, too, ... and when he
looked up a morose, almost a
malignant, scowl blackened his
features.</td>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Heathcliffe and Rochester are both black-avised, stubborn of
countenance, negligent as to external appearance, moody, proud in
carry, and morose. Charlotte Bront&euml; tells us of one that on external
judgment "most people would have thought him" possessed of a
disqualification, and of the other that "some people might suspect
him" of having a disqualification. And in each case a similar
offset&mdash;the internal reading of the man's character&mdash;is brought
forth by Charlotte Bront&euml; as Lockwood or Jane:&mdash;"A sympathetic
cord within" tells the former that Heathcliffe's reserve read as under-bred
pride springs from an aversion to "manifestations of mutual
kindliness"; and Jane, commenting on Rochester's being proud and
sardonic, says, "In my secret heart I knew ... his kindliness to
me was balanced by unjust severity to others."</p>

<p>I find the singular expression indicated by the "hell's light"
epithets applied to Heathcliffe's eyes was an expression Charlotte
Bront&euml; had apparently noticed in the original of this character.
Rochester's eyes in <i>Jane Eyre</i> have "strange gleams," and we are
told "his eye had a tawny&mdash;nay, a bloody light in its gloom," and
so forth. Indeed, Heathcliffe's eyes, which were "clouded windows
of hell" with "black-fire in them," are seen in Rochester's clearly
enough, and the singular "hell's light" is associated with them at
considerable length, in</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><i>Jane Eyre</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>And as for the vague something&mdash;was it a sinister or a sorrowful
... expression?&mdash;that opened upon a careful observer ... in his eye,
and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially
disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I
had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly
felt the ground quiver and seen it gape.</p></div>

<p>The following description of Heathcliffe could be read as of
Rochester, whose "olive cheek" and "deep eyes" Jane describes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><i>Wuthering Heights.</i></p>

<p>His cheeks were sallow and half-covered with black whiskers, the
brows were lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular. I remembered
the eyes. His upright carry suggested his having been in the army
[M. H&eacute;ger had fought as a soldier] ... His countenance ... looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
intelligent. A half-civilized ferocity lurked in the depressed brows and
eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued, and his manner was even
dignified, though too stern for grace.</p></div>

<p>In view of the general evidence that Heathcliffe, like Rochester,
was drawn by Charlotte Bront&euml; from M. H&eacute;ger, her Brussels friend
the professor, it is not surprising that Heathcliffe's was "a deep
voice and foreign in sound." Her reference in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
to his Spanish extraction reminds us of M. Paul Emanuel's "jetty
hair and Spanish face" in <i>Villette</i>, and of course it is well known
M. Paul Emanuel was drawn by Currer Bell from M. H&eacute;ger.</p>

  <td class='tdl'>On [an] ... evening ... I
was coming from the garden....
It had got dusk, ... the moon
causing ... shadows to lurk in
the corners of ... portions of
the building. I set my burden
on the house steps by the ...
door and lingered to rest ...
my back to the entrance, when
I heard a voice behind me
say:&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... Is that you?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a deep voice, and
foreign in sound.... Something
stirred in the porch; and moving
nearer I distinguished a tall man
dressed in dark clothes, with dark
face and hair. He leant against
the side, and held his fingers on
the latch as if intending to open
for himself.... A ray fell on his
features; the cheeks were sallow,
and half-covered with black
whiskers; the brows lowering,
the eyes deep-set and singular.
I remembered the eyes.</td>
  <td class='tdl'>... I came, just ere dark
... the darkness ... of dusk
gathered.... I beheld the
house&mdash;scarce by this dim light
distinguishable.... Entering a
portal fastened by a latch,
... I stood.... The windows
were latticed, ... the front door
was narrow; ... one step led up
to it.... I heard a movement&mdash;that
narrow front-door was unclosing,
and some shape was
about to issue from the grange.
[Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> version of the returned
runaway lover, is also staged at
"the grange."] It opened
slowly: a figure came out into
the twilight and stood on the
step; a man, ... he stretched
forth his hand.... Dusk as it
was I had recognized him&mdash;it
was my master ... Rochester.
I stayed my step, almost my
breath.... His form was of
the same strong and stalwart
contour as ever: his port was
still erect, his hair was still
raven-black: nor were his features
altered or sunk.... But in his
countenance I saw a change:
that looked desperate and brooding&mdash;that
reminded me of some
wronged and fettered wild beast
or bird, dangerous to approach
in his sullen woe.... He closed
the door. I now drew near and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
knocked: John's wife opened
for me.... She started as if
she had seen a ghost: I calmed
her. To her hurried "Is it
really you, Miss, come at this
late hour...?" I answered by
taking her hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='tdl'>"What!" I cried, uncertain
whether to regard him as a
worldly visitor, and raised my
hands in amazement. "What!
you come back? Is it really
you? Is it?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; Heathcliffe," he replied ... "where
is she?... Is she
here? Speak! I want to have
one word with her&mdash;your mistress
[Catherine]. Go, and say
some person ... desires to see
her."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... And you <i>are</i> Heathcliffe.
But altered!"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I could not persuade
myself to proceed. At length I
resolved on making an excuse
to ask if ... [Catherine] would
have the candles lighted, and I
opened the door. [She] sat ...
by a window whose lattice lay
back.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does he want?" asked
Catherine.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not question him," I
answered.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Mr. Edgar inquired ...
who it was?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some one mistress does not
expect," I replied. "That Heathcliffe....
Hush! you must not
call him ... names.... She'd
be sadly grieved to hear you.
She was nearly heart-broken
when he ran off. I guess his
return will make a jubilee to
her."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, ... Heathcliffe's come
back&mdash;he is," panted Catherine.
"... I'll ... secure my guest.
I'm afraid the joy is too great to
be real!"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... Catherine, try to be glad
without being absurd! The whole
household need not witness the
sight of your welcoming a runaway
servant."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I ... found Heathcliffe ...
and ushered him into the presence
of the master and mistress.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Now, I was amazed [by]
the transformation of Heathcliffe;...
A half-civilized ferocity lurked
yet in the depressed brows and
eyes full of black fire, but it was
subdued, quite divested of roughness,
though too stern for grace....
He took a seat opposite
Catherine, who kept her gaze
fixed on him, as if she feared he
would vanish were she to remove
it. He did not raise his to her
often; a quick glance now and
then sufficed; but it flashed back
each time; ... the undisguised
delight he drank from hers....
Catherine ... rose and seized
Heathcliffe's hands again, and
laughed like one beside herself.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "I shall think it a dream to-morrow!"
she cried. "I shall
not be able to believe that I have
seen and touched, and spoken to
you once more.... Cruel
Heathcliffe! You don't deserve
this welcome. To be absent and
silent for three years, and never
to think of me!"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... I've fought through a
bitter life since I last heard your
voice, and you must forgive me,
for I struggled only for you!"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... The event of this evening,"
said Catherine, "has reconciled
me to God and humanity!
I had risen in angry rebellion
against Providence&mdash;oh, I've
endured very, very bitter misery....
I can afford to suffer anything
hereafter! Should the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
meanest thing alive slap me on
the cheek, I'd not only turn the
other, but I'd ask pardon for provoking
it.... I'm an angel!"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Later on in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
Charlotte Bront&euml;, temporarily
neglecting her use of Method I.,
interchange of the sexes, in this
connection, makes Heathcliffe
say to Catherine:&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did you betray your
own heart, Cathy?... You
loved me, then what <i>right</i> had
you to leave me?... Because
misery and degradation and death
and nothing that God or Satan
could inflict would have parted
us, <i>you</i> of your own will did it.").</td>
  <td class='tdl'>"... Tell your master ... a
person wishes to speak to him."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; When she returned, I inquired
what he had said.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are to send in your
name and business," she replied.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; She then proceeded to fill a
glass of water, and place it on a
tray, together with candles.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that what he rang for?"
I asked.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes; he always has candles
brought in at dusk...."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give the tray to me, I will
carry it in."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Mary opened the door
for me.... Mr. Rochester
turned mechanically.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is you, Mary, is it
not?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mary is in the kitchen," I
answered.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>Who</i> is it? <i>What</i> is it?
Who speaks?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... I came only this evening,"
I answered.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great God!&mdash;what delusion
has come over me? What sweet
madness has seized me?...
Oh! I <i>cannot</i> see.... Whatever&mdash;whoever
you are&mdash;be perceptible
to my touch or I cannot
live!"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrested his hand and prisoned
it in both mine.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that Jane?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... This is her voice," I
added.... "My dear master, ... I
am Jane Eyre:... I am
come back to you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span><br />


&nbsp;&nbsp; "In truth?&mdash;in the flesh? My
living Jane?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "You touch me, sir&mdash;you hold
me. I am not vacant like air,
am I?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... But I cannot be so blest
after all my misery. It is a
dream: such dreams I have had....
But I always woke and
found it an empty mockery; and
I was desolate and abandoned."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I began ... to withdraw
myself from his arms&mdash;but he
eagerly snatched me closer:&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you must not go. No&mdash;I
have touched you, heard you;
... my very soul demands you....
Who can tell what a dark,
hopeless life I have dragged on
for months past? ... feeling but
a ceaseless sorrow, and at times a
very delirium of desire to behold
my Jane again. Yes; for her
restoration I longed.... Will
she not depart as suddenly as she
came? To-morrow ... I shall
find her no more.... Cruel,
cruel deserter! O Jane, what
did I feel when I discovered you
had fled and left Thornfield?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jane! ... my heart swells
with gratitude to the beneficent
God of this earth just now....
I did wrong: I would have sullied
my innocent flower: the Omnipotent
snatched it from me. I, in
my stiff-necked rebellion, almost
cursed the dispensation: instead
of bending to the decree I defied
it.... Of late, Jane, ... I
began to experience remorse, repentance;
the wish for reconciliation
to my Maker.... Now I
thank God."</td>

<p>The absolute dependence of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <i>Wuthering

<h3>EUG&Egrave;NE SUE AND CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;'S BRUSSELS LIFE.</h3>


<h3><b>I.</b></h3>

<h4>MDLLE. LAGRANGE AND HER MANUSCRIPT "CATHERINE BELL
THE ORPHAN."</h4>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">When</span> Mrs. Gaskell published her Bront&euml; biography it was discovered
that while she had been enabled by aid of the mass of
commonplace Bront&euml; correspondence to present an interesting
picture of the domestic conditions at the Haworth parsonage, she
had yet been unable to throw any light upon that episode in
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s life which, it had been suspected, was responsible
for the extraordinary love passages in the Bront&euml; works and Miss
Bront&euml;'s insistence in choosing the hero of each of her books from
the same model.</p>

<p>It is therefore most miraculous and sensational that after having
found Montagu's <i>Gleanings in Craven</i> was the key to <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>, I should further come to discover, what the
world had thought would never be found: external evidence throwing
light upon Miss Bront&euml;'s real relations with the H&eacute;gers at
Brussels, to whose <i>pensionnat</i> she went in the 'forties. This discovery
was the subject of my article "The Lifting of the Bront&euml; Veil"
Mr. W. L. Courtney commissioned me to write in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>. Therein I showed Eug&egrave;ne Sue had presented the whole
history of M. H&eacute;ger's passion for Charlotte Bront&euml;, and Madame
H&eacute;ger's jealousy, in a work entitled <i>Miss Mary ou l'Institutrice</i>,
published in 1850-51&mdash;seven years before the publication of Mrs.
Gaskell's <i>Life</i>, and before the publication of either <i>The Professor</i> or
<i>Villette</i>; and we saw that M. H&eacute;ger knew all Miss Bront&euml;'s literary
secrets in 1850.</p>

<p>Skilfully enough Eug&egrave;ne Sue in this story&mdash;the first version of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
which was issued serially in September 1850, from <i>The Weekly Times</i>
Office, London, whence were published many of M. Sue's serials;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
the second, an abridged and altered version for French readers,
published in Paris in March 1851&mdash;gave two phases of Charlotte
Bront&euml;, something after the method we see Miss Bront&euml; herself
employed in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, wherein she gave two phases of Tabitha
Aykroyd, one in the beginning as Bessie, another later on as Hannah
of the Rivers family.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Indeed it will be found that in this work Eug&egrave;ne Sue also imitated
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Method I., interchange of the sexes of characters
portrayed from life.</p>

<p>The two phases of Miss Bront&euml; in this romance are Miss Mary
Lawson, an Irish governess at the de Morville establishment; and
Mademoiselle Lagrange, a former governess at the same house.
The Mademoiselle Lagrange is, however, always referred to in the
abstract, and serves to illustrate, it appears, Miss Bront&euml; before her
first departure from and return to Brussels, as well as after, for she
was twice at the H&eacute;gers. And it may be observed that Charlotte
Bront&euml; was called "Mademoiselle Charlotte" at the H&eacute;ger <i>pension</i>
when she was governess there in 1843. Certainly the choice of
Lagrange for Miss Bront&euml; was pertinent: <i>la grange</i> is French for
"the barn," and may have been suggested by the Eyre of <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
which to a French ear would recall <i>aire</i>&mdash;a barn floor. Mdlle.
Lagrange who had left the de Morville (<i>Anglic&egrave;</i>, Morton. As we
have seen, Morton of <i>Jane Eyre</i> was Haworth to Charlotte Bront&euml;)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
establishment on account of the jealousy of Madame de Morville,
whom I identify as Madame H&eacute;ger, is a plain-featured literary
aspirant, and she writes a manuscript entitled not exactly Currer
Bell, but "Kitty Bell, the Orphan."</p>

<p>This manuscript has been sent by the author for an opinion of
its merits to M. de Morville, who reads it aloud to his family. It is
a parody, as it were, of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, with an imitation of Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s methods of introducing private biographical facts. For
instance, in presenting the Lowood school incidents it calls the
school "the Kendall Institute," named after "a Mr. Kendall, its
founder." Evidently the writer had heard, as only few indeed had
at this early day, that the Lowood school of <i>Jane Eyre</i> was afterwards
removed to Casterton in the Union of Kendal, or had heard that in a
wise it was connected with a place of that name.</p>

<p>Other extraordinary facts with which he shows acquaintance are,
that Charlotte Bront&euml; had a sister Elizabeth at this school; that
Helen Burns was her sister; that there was a West Indian girl at the
school; that Charlotte Bront&euml; was born on or about the 21st of
April; that she might be called Kitty (Currer) Bell at home, but she
must be called Catherine (Catherine Earnshaw); that Miss Bront&euml;
was the governess-daughter of an Irishman; that the original of
John Reed was her brother and was no hero, and had shown strange
signs of insanity during the last year or two, as it is now known he
had at the time; that a female relative had provided Miss Bront&euml;
the money for the <i>pensionnat</i>; that skin disorders as well as the
typhus fever were prevalent at the Clergy Daughters' School (it is in
a private letter that Miss Bront&euml; referred to scrofula at this school);
that the original of Mr. Rochester was a foreigner and a resident
abroad, an ex-soldier, and married to a lady who was not pretty,
albeit "la vivacit&eacute;, l'agr&eacute;ment de sa physionomie expressive, suppl&eacute;aient
&agrave; la beaut&eacute; qui lui manquait"; that Charlotte Bront&euml; had had
in her possession since her childhood an old copy in English of <i>The
Imitation of Christ</i>; that Miss Bront&euml; was called a <i>bas bleu</i> at the
<i>pensionnat</i>; that to form an opinion of her character by Madame
H&eacute;ger's estimate of her disposition would be completely erroneous;
that M. H&eacute;ger was accustomed to read <i>feuilletons</i> aloud; that
religious differences existed between her and others at the establishment
where Charlotte Bront&euml; was; that Catherine's (Catherine
Earnshaw's) rival was Isabella (Heathcliffe's wife&mdash;Madame H&eacute;ger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of the Rue d'Isabelle); that Miss Bront&euml; travelled alone to Brussels
and was accosted by <i>deux jeunes gens</i>&mdash;compare the opening chapters
of <i>Miss Mary</i> with Lucy Snowe's arrival at Villette, evidently in some
wise founded on fact, as to these two young men. See also <i>The
Professor</i>, Chapter VII.</p>

<p>But to return to "Mdlle. Lagrange's Manuscript," the pseudo <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, which of course at once identifies its author, Mdlle. Lagrange,
as Charlotte Bront&euml;, I find therein the whole Lowood school
incidents&mdash;the typhus fever, the hair-cutting incident, the death of
the consumptive Helen Burns, etc., amplified with biographical
additions. For instance, take the hair-cutting incident of <i>Jane Eyre</i>
as represented in "Lagrange's Manuscript"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The master called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Elizabeth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>... Meanwhile all the Elizabeths in the school must have felt the
claws of the tiger in their necks, for who could tell which of them
it was?...</p>

<p>"Superintendent of the Kendall Institute! you are aware, madam,
one of the rules of this establishment enjoins you to cut short the hair of
every new girl.... And yet what do I see? Six girls with long
hair...."</p>

<p>The last of these had not been a week at the institution. She was a
girl of fourteen, very dark, ... with a fine tinge of the Creole in her face.
How well I thought did Isabella Hutchinson, with her dark, West Indian
head, look by the side of the fair Yorkshire girl, Sophia Leigh, whose pale,
straw-coloured locks, looked paler still by the side of that dark heap of
hair, blacker than a raven's wing...[!]</p></div>

<p>We have seen in the chapter on "The Rivers or Bront&euml; Family
in <i>Jane Eyre</i>" that Charlotte Bront&euml; portrayed in the character Julia
Severn, who is first mentioned in connection with the hair-cutting
incident, her sister Elizabeth, and it is most significant that M. Sue
made play upon the name Elizabeth in the connection. In regard
to the mention of a West Indian girl at the Lowood school and her
being coupled with a fair-haired Yorkshire girl, it is important to note
that no reference is made in <i>Jane Eyre</i> to a West Indian girl
at this school. It is indeed astonishing how much M. Sue knew of
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s private life. Here we find him telling the world
in 1850 of a West Indian girl being with Charlotte Bront&euml; at the
Clergy Daughters' School, and not till seven years later did Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Gaskell learn of the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml; was then
dead&mdash;that a girl from the West Indies had been Charlotte's friend
at this school. Her name, he thought, was Mellany Hane, so far as
he could remember to pronounce it. Mysteriously enough, the words
"West Indies" or "West Indian" in this connection have been
deleted from the later editions of Mrs. Gaskell's <i>Life of Charlotte
Bront&euml;</i>. See the Second Edition.</p>

<p>"Lagrange's Manuscript" is of considerable length and interest,
and can be drawn upon in future editions of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml;
Works</i>. Frequently it follows in parallel to <i>Jane Eyre</i>, but as
parody interspersed with biographical details which must have been
intended chiefly for Charlotte Bront&euml; herself, as scarcely any one else
could at that day have understood the pertinence of the references.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Take a Helen Burns incident whereby M. Sue shows he is aware she
was a Bront&euml; sister, older than Charlotte&mdash;Maria Bront&euml; who
died of consumption:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But the inexorable hand ... was upon Agnes Jones [Helen Burns].
Day by day I saw her pretty cheeks growing thinner and thinner, her
eyes sinking still more deeply into her head, her little mouth becoming
more blue and ashy, her long, thin fingers more transparent. Her voice,
at all times so meek and low, dwindled away to that thin and tiny sound
to which we listen as to something absent&mdash;already gone&mdash;something
that comes from above or below us&mdash;that is not living amongst us&mdash;not
breathing as we breathe&mdash;a retreating echo, rather than a living voice&mdash;a
sigh, and not a sound.... It was not much I had learned from Agnes
[Helen] since I had been at the institution; but never till then had I
known her spirit so genial, her heart so lovingly persuasive; the
beneficent lessons of those days, burning like candles within me, have
since guided me well through life: <i>she spoke to me like a prophet, and I
listened to her like a believer</i>. Oh, I could have lived for ever in that
chamber, and Agnes [Helen] might have been to me the world! How
often, as our cheeks lay against each other have I wished that I, too, had
been ill, so that I also might have died, as she was dying, in my
innocence!... One evening, ... just at that pleasant hour of twilight
when two of God's wonders&mdash;night and day&mdash;cross each other like ships
on the sea, Agnes [Helen] said:&mdash;'Life has its holiness as well as death,
Catherine [Jane]; and you may live in the world as purely and justly as
those who die in the cradle.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"The world is full of temptation?"</p>

<p>"So it is, but there lies the merit, my dear; wrestle with temptation
and do what is right, ... you must not allow my death to afflict you
much, since I rejoice at it.... If you think of me, think of me living, not
dead. Think of your playfellow in the garden; think of your elder sister
who lived with you for six years."</p></div>

<p>Maria Bront&euml;, Charlotte's eldest sister, and the original of Helen
Burns, died when Charlotte was eight or nine. It is sensational
indeed, that M. Sue thus identified Helen Burns seven years before
the publication of Mrs. Gaskell's <i>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</i>. The
death of this character in "Lagrange's Manuscript" is in perfect agreement
with that of Helen Burns. I will place the two side by side:&mdash;</p>

  <td class='tdl'>That forest dell, where Lowood
lay, was the cradle of ... fog-bred
pestilence, which ... crept
into the Orphan Asylum, breathed
typhus through [it] ... and transformed
the seminary into a hospital....
One evening ...
Mr. Bates came out, and ...
a nurse.... I ran up to her.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is Helen Burns?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very poorly," was the answer....
Two hours later ...
I reached ... Miss Temple's
room, ... I looked in. My
eye sought Helen, and feared to
find death.... "Helen!" I
whispered softly; "are you
awake?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I got on to her crib and
kissed her: her forehead was
cold, and her cheek both cold
and thin, and so were her hand
and wrist, but she smiled as of
old.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jane, ... lie down and
cover yourself with the quilt."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; I did so: she put her arm over
me, and I nestled close to her.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I clasped my arms closer
round Helen; she seemed dearer
to me than ever; I felt as if I
could not let her go; I lay with
my face hidden on her neck.
Presently she said:&mdash;"... Don't
leave me, Jane; I like to have
you near me."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll stay with you, <i>dear</i> Helen;
no one shall take me away."...
She kissed me, and I her; and
we soon slumbered. When I
awoke it was day; an unusual
movement roused me.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; A day or two afterwards, I
learned that Miss Temple, on
returning to her own room at
dawn, had found me laid in a
little crib; my face against Helen
Burn's shoulder, my arms round
her neck. I was asleep, and
Helen was&mdash;dead.</td>
  <td class='tdl'>The Master of the Kendall
Institution ... had ... been
very much shocked by the
ravages of typhus fever, and
since the reports of Agnes's
health had become serious, had
sent several times to ascertain
how she was.... "Miss Bell,
I am come to inquire after our
friend, Miss Jones."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "... Agnes is always calm
and easy-minded.... This is
very kind of you."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; ... As I was preparing to lie
down in the room, Agnes called
to me:&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catherine, my dear, I feel
rather cold to-night; will you
sleep with me?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I complied, and we
lay talking in each other's arms
until the sweet dove fell asleep.
Poor Agnes, she was indeed
cold; a strange chill came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
through me as I lay by her side....
I still heard my sister
orphan breathe and pant....
Why did I listen ... so
greedily? Why&mdash;when the poor
thing turned round once in the
night, and said: "Another kiss,
Catherine!"&mdash;why did I feel in
giving it her, as if a hundred
steel arrows had gone through
my heart? How long I lay
awake and thinking&mdash;wondering
at the cold emerging from the
pure body at my side, I know
not! I must have slept, too; for
I remember opening my eyes
with the first dawn, before the
bells rang.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; "Agnes!" said I, softly; "are
you awake?"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was no answer!...
I called again&mdash;then a third, and
a fourth time! But still ... no
reply! Wondering at this silence,
... I listened for that hard
breathing I knew so well. But
nothing&mdash;not a sound could I
hear! Alarmed, but unwilling to
trust my fears, I felt for her
hand. Oh, God! it was cold as
ice, and rigid as stone! Wild
with affright, ... I started up
... and rushed out to call the
Superintendent [Miss Temple].
I found her preparing to come to
us.... When we entered the
chamber, we found no Agnes
there! No; her spirit had fled,
and all we saw was the lifeless
body of a poor houseless girl.</td>

<p>Another biographical passage occurs where Catherine Bell first
sees the Miss Temple of "Lagrange's Manuscript," who herself,
under the name of Ashton (Eshton),<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is at times Miss Bront&euml;, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
took the name of the original of Miss Temple (Evans) for herself in
the phase of Frances Evans Henri in <i>The Professor</i>, a work not
published, we must note, till after Charlotte Bront&euml;'s death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I love you, madam," I said.</p>

<p>"Your name, I believe, is Catherine Bell, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Kitty Bell, if you please, madam," I answered.</p>

<p>"Kitty Bell at home, my dear, but here we must call you Catherine;
for a school, you know, is where many forms must be observed. How
old are you?"</p>

<p>"I shall be ten next birthday, madam."</p>

<p>"And when will that be?"</p>

<p>"On the 23rd of April."</p>

<p>"Shakespeare's Day, I declare!"</p></div>

<p>The above is, of course, not in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. There is a stroke of
sarcasm in the last sentence. It would appear that Currer Bell
playfully had moved her birthday forward two days, in her private
conversation with one from whom M. Sue had gleaned information&mdash;and
this could be only M. H&eacute;ger himself. Charlotte Bront&euml;, as Lucy
Snowe, in <i>Villette</i>, Chapter XLI., tells us that M. Paul Emanuel
(M. H&eacute;ger) said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wanted to prove to Miss Lucy that I <i>could</i> keep a secret.
How often has she taunted me with lack of dignified reserve and
needful caution! How many times has she saucily insinuated that
all my affairs are the secret of Polichinelle!" And this had doubtless
a reference to some such indiscretions as resulted in M. Sue whilst
at Brussels (and he was publishing <i>L'Orgueil</i> from Brussels in 1844,
in the January of which year Charlotte Bront&euml; arrived home from the
Belgian capital), learning the literary secrets of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and
perhaps <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.</p>

<p>A further reference to Currer Bell's literary aspirations&mdash;in the
spirit of Mdlle. Reuter's sneers, in <i>The Professor</i>, at Mdlle. Henri's
literary ambition&mdash;occurs in M. Sue's <i>feuilleton</i> in another version of
the fortune-telling incident of <i>Jane Eyre</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here," said I, to a brown, sunburnt damsel, ... "take this shilling
and tell me when I shall be Empress of Morocco?"</p>

<p>I held out my hand.... The young girl looked at it, ... then shook
her head doubtfully:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>"Your life, lady, will be a troubled one&mdash;full of hopes and fears!"</p>

<p>"So I suppose; most people's lives are pretty well divided in this
manner."</p>

<p>"But not so much as yours will be.... First, you are without father
or mother?... Without fortune, too?"</p>

<p>"True, what more?"</p>

<p>"You will be married and not married."</p>

<p>"That's impossible. What can you mean by married and not
married?"</p>

<p>"That deserves another shilling!"</p>

<p>"No; I only want a shillingsworth, ... that will do for to-day."</p></div>

<p>"Mdlle. Lagrange's Manuscript" was bound in blue morocco
leather, and the term "Empress of Morocco" may have a reference
to a literary ambition, as has the "Shakspeare's Day, I declare!"
passage.</p>

<p>For constructive purposes the West Indian girl, or Creole, in
"Lagrange's Manuscript," is made to take the place of the Mrs.
Rochester of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, who is therein represented as a Creole:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I did my best [continues Catherine Bell] to make a friend of her,
but to no purpose. Whatever was the reason she disliked me from the
first. ["I am convinced she does not like me," wrote Charlotte to Emily
of Madame H&eacute;ger.] I felt intuitively she was my enemy.... Had we
been thrown together when I was a child [!] I should probably have
suited her ... for at that time I was a little given to flattery myself.
But that was before I had learned how many better things there are than
mere beauty.... Perhaps ... I preferred more solid advantages,
because my vanity assured me that I had them myself, whilst my personal
appearance was insignificant compared with hers. I was certainly fond
of talking of what I knew, which answered very well with those who
knew as much, and was rather pleasing to those who knew more. [M.
H&eacute;ger seems to have found pleasure in his intellectual talks with Currer
Bell], but to Isabella [this, as I have said, is the name of Catherine's
rival in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, who was married to Heathcliffe] it was hateful.
She imagined I wanted to expose her ignorance.</p></div>

<p>I have given some of the biographical facts respecting Miss
Bront&euml; embodied in Mdlle. Lagrange's story, and before closing this
chapter dealing with that extraordinary manuscript I will print a
further extract or so from it. The opening is as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">"KITTY BELL, THE ORPHAN."</p>

<p>I was not above four years old when my mother died, my father
having gone to his grave two years before.... Oh, it is a sad, sad
thing to be an orphan!... My little head has been cut with more than
one fall, and blood has flowed down my neck. But nobody cared....
It was only Kitty Bell.... There was no loving heart to take me to itself
and soothe me.... I had been taken home by some relation of my
mother, ... a widow [Mrs. Burke], and though she treated me with
great rigour, she melted on her death-bed.</p></div>

<p>She is locked in the room wherein Mrs. Burke died, after the
manner of the same incident in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and the writer takes an
opportunity of inserting the most distinctive feature of <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
the light-bearing apparition, the original of which I have shown
Charlotte Bront&euml; found in Montagu's <i>Gleanings in Craven</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Suddenly there came a gleam of light through the key-hole, ...
and now I could hear a short, heavy tread upon the stairs&mdash;it was coming
up.... The gleam shot through the key-hole a third time, with treble
radiance. But what had I seen?... Was it a vision? was it a ghost?
It was a tall figure in white, like a winding sheet, with a hideous face
and balls of gleaming fire where the eyes should be. The sight had
stunned and levelled me almost like a blow on the temple.... I cannot
say how long I continued in this swoon, but when I began to recover
myself I was in my own bed.</p></div>

<p>She had received medical treatment, she learns as did Jane Eyre
in the similar incident. The "ghost," however, had been only
George Burke&mdash;the John Reed of <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Hence the choice of
the name Burke by reason of its connection with the Hare of the
Burke and Hare association, the writer by this choice showing his
acquaintance with the fact that in real life the Reeds and Jane Eyre
were relations. After this incident the story is for a while occupied
with the petty happenings connected with this orphan who "was not
yet nine years old." An aunt of the Burkes [? Aunt Branwell]
comes to live with them, a "poor, quiet, elderly spinster who paid
a small stipend in order to preserve her independence and keep up
her dignity.... I must not attempt to describe her ... she was
fully six feet high." This is palpably antithetical: Miss Branwell
was not tall. And it is this aunt who provides the money for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Catherine Bell to go to school. Under the guise of presenting the
Lowood school in "Lagrange's Manuscript," M. Sue gives us often
the H&eacute;ger <i>pensionnat</i>. Aunt Branwell provided Charlotte Bront&euml;
the money that enabled her to go to the H&eacute;gers'.</p>

<p>I will give in parallel columns the arrival of Charlotte Bront&euml; at
the Clergy Daughters' Institute as it is described in "Mademoiselle
Lagrange's Manuscript," and in <i>Jane Eyre</i> the original:&mdash;</p>

<p>Often Mdlle. Lagrange's "Kitty Bell the Orphan" is mysterious
in its allusions. As when Catherine Bell says she does not like a
French lady teacher. The seed-cake incident of Chapter VIII. of
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, which is given at length in "Lagrange's Manuscript," is
herewith worked in again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I don't like Madame Dubois...."</p>

<p>"Why so? she is a very good sort of a woman."</p>

<p>"That may be, but she takes snuff...."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>"What is that to you or me, Catherine Bell? Surely it is no business
of ours?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes it is, though.... I gave her a slice of my seed-cake
yesterday, and she returned me half of it."</p>

<p>"That showed a good disposition in poor Madame Dubois; did it
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but when I was going to eat it myself I was seized with a fit of
sneezing, which I shall not forget in a hurry, I promise you!"</p>

<p>"You took snuff then, Catherine Bell, for the first time in your life?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">All in&mdash;all in&mdash;for school!</span>" shouted the teachers and examples
that moment.</p></div>

<p>The following is an extract dealing with the fever scenes of <i>Jane
Eyre</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fever and consumption had fixed their abode under the large roof
of Kendall Institution, death was stealing along with its soft, wolf-like
tread, to feed upon these poor children. The first symptoms I remember
that startled me were certain cold shiverings and sudden fits of perspiration
without warmth, which seized upon the younger children.
Then sickness and nausea, followed immediately by vomiting. [M.
Sue had been a surgeon.] ... Oh, how cruel, how bitter it was to us
when we saw the first little coffin borne out of the school!... And now
we began to hear, for the first time, the dismal word <i>typhus</i> uttered here
and there in whispers through the school.... When we went to the
church on Sundays, and saw the many little mounds of fresh black earth
lying over our innocent playmates of yesterday, our heads sank upon our
bosoms and we wept most sorrowfully.</p></div>

<p>Faithful to its model, "Lagrange's Manuscript" brings Isabella
the Creole as the rival of Catherine Bell, and thus of the Creole's
husband Catherine writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Unwittingly, and quite unknown to myself, I became the object of his
admiration&mdash;nay, of his marked preference; but I rejected indignantly
the homage of an affection which he had sworn to another, and which it
was his sacred duty to preserve undefiled.... In the hope of overcoming
my persistency in refusing his so often proffered and as often rejected
love, he urged on by every imaginable means the final decision, which in
the eyes of man were to permit a second marriage, guilty in the sight of
God. With the natural instinct of divination peculiar to female jealousy,
his wife had guessed who was the deity at whose altar the captain was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
burning his incense.... Nor did she consider whether I encouraged
or rebuked him. She suspected, she spied, she believed, and unscrupulously
involved me in the hateful vengeance she swore to take both
on her husband and myself.</p></div>

<p>For a portrait of Mdlle. Lagrange who, as the author of this
version of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, is of course meant for Charlotte Bront&euml;, we
turn to the <i>feuilleton</i> itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Meanwhile we have lost sight of our blue-stocking friend, Mdlle.
Lagrange ['Madame herself deemed me a regular <i>bas bleu</i>,' says Lucy
Snowe of Madame Beck (Madame H&eacute;ger) in <i>Villette</i>] ... her character
... remains to be described. Now, to form any opinion of it by Madame
de Morville's [Madame H&eacute;ger's] appreciation of that girl's disposition,
would be completely erroneous. Lagrange was not devoid of intellectual
faculties; she possessed an imaginative mind, rather too fond of romance,
and too little of practical truths; but, above all, cunning and ambition
formed the main basis of her character: she had risen from nothing, and
<i>would</i> become something. Imbued as she was with the ideas prevalent
among the lower rank [Had Charlotte Bront&euml; related her father's
history to the H&eacute;gers? She had 'views' on money. M. Sue, however,
never seems to have forgotten the rank of his own god-parents], she
deemed it her right and duty to concentrate all the power of her faculties
towards the end she sighed for&mdash;wealth and a name. Thus it was she
displayed all the resources of her subtle nature to make every circumstance
serve to the gratifying of her ambition. What, then, was to be her
means of success? Marriage?&mdash;yes, that perpetual dream of maidens,
and a dream which too often ends in an everlasting nightmare. But the
task was not easy, for, it has been said, beauty had been forgotten by
Dame Nature among the few gifts she had granted her.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> What the
appearance failed in, the mind should, at any cost, supply [!]. This had
become her ruling desire. Thence the manuscript ['Catherine Bell, The
Orphan'] we have already read had been the first ponderous lucubration

attempt by her friends, and also by one two distinguished critics.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This

<p>Thus far the Mdlle. Lagrange phase of Currer Bell according to
Eug&egrave;ne Sue, and before the publication of <i>The Professor</i>, <i>Villette</i>,
and Mrs. Gaskell's <i>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</i>. The next chapter shall
deal with Eug&egrave;ne Sue's relation of her as "Miss Mary," the leading
character of this extraordinary <i>feuilleton</i>, whereby it will be proved
finally that in her works Charlotte Bront&euml; has written from her own
life-story.</p>

<h3>EUG&Egrave;NE SUE AND CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;'S BRUSSELS LIFE.</h3>

<h3><b>II.</b></h3>

<h4>ACCUSATIONS AND PROTESTATIONS!</h4>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">I have</span> said Eug&egrave;ne Sue, in <i>Miss Mary ou l'Institutrice</i>, gave two
phases of Charlotte Bront&euml;. With the one as Mdlle. Lagrange I
dealt in the preceding chapter, and now I write concerning that
wherein Miss Bront&euml; is openly represented as the Irish governess at
the de Morville establishment.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Easy it is to recognize this character
is a phase of Charlotte Bront&euml;, but as her pupil Alphonsine
puts it plainly in describing her, she is "Mdlle. Lagrange, avec la
beaut&eacute; de plus"&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml;, with beauty and virtues exaggerated.
The following incident I find only in the <i>feuilleton</i> (not
the extant volume), the which circumstances support as history concerning
the days of Miss Bront&euml;'s dejection at the Brussels <i>pensionnat</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
It should be read in the light of the lines in Chapter XIX. of <i>The
Professor</i>, where she, as Frances Evans Henri, tells Crimsworth,
obviously M. H&eacute;ger, that he remarked her <i>devoirs</i> dwelt a great deal
on fortitude in bearing grief. In the evening Alphonsine, M. de
Morville's daughter, who says many things we know must have issued
from M. H&eacute;ger's lips&mdash;(this is in palpable imitation of Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s Method I., interchange of the sexes of characters portrayed
from life. For further use of this method see also the close of
Chapter XII. and elsewhere in <i>The Professor</i>, and my writing on
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>)&mdash;pays a visit to the chamber of
the Irish governess:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Were you not reading?... I see a book on your work-table. May
I look?... <i>The Imitation of Christ!</i>" exclaimed Alphonsine, after
having read the title-page. "Oh! this is a beautiful book, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Truly beautiful!" answered Mary; "the cover is old, the pages worn
out in many places. You must not wonder at it: from the age I began to
read, I don't think I ever passed three nights without reading at least one
chapter of this admirable work."</p></div>

<p><i>The Imitation of Christ</i> in English was a book Charlotte Bront&euml;
was setting much store upon when she was but nine years of age.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Her copy was then an old one. Evidently she took the book with
her to Brussels and read it at the <i>pensionnat</i>. It would seem M.
H&eacute;ger, whom she instructed in English, requested to hear the work
in this English translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Pray what chapter were you reading?" continues Alphonsine. "I
should so much like to hear you read it to me: I have occasionally read a
page of <i>The Imitation</i>, but always in French; now, if you would be so
good as to read slowly and pronounce very distinctly, I think I could
understand this pious work in your language."</p></div>

<p>She read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">The Necessity of Humble Submission.</span></p>

<p>"Let your conscience be pure, and surely God will know how to
defend you.... Learn to suffer in silence, without repining, and you will
... receive assistance from Him."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>"What a truthful, becalming lesson!" observed Alphonsine; "you
will read to me every evening some passage of your <i>Imitation</i>, will you
not? English sounds so sweetly to my ear when spoken by you. We
will begin to-morrow evening, n'est ce pas?"</p></div>

<p>Surely this is M. H&eacute;ger and his sympathetic, depressed English
teacher.</p>

<p>There is in the opening chapter of <i>Miss Mary</i> a long conversation
regarding the departed governess Lagrange, and Madame
de Morville (Madame H&eacute;ger) avows she had been jealous of her, and
that her harshness towards the governess had resulted in her abruptly
leaving on a false plea of ill-health. Thus she says to M. de
Morville:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am speaking seriously to you of my foolish but most acute
sufferings ... tandis que tu restais seul ici avec tes livres. You never
suspected them;... I endeavoured to suppress them, to suffer no part
of what I felt to transpire; for I must confess poor Lagrange was quite
the lamb du bon Dieu, yet in spite of myself I sometimes broke out into
fits of petulance and absurd irony, which wounded her. I saw it did by
the sudden dejection of that excellent young person. But even this was
not all."</p>

<p>"Louise! is it you who speaks thus? You whose kind, benevolent
heart I have so often admired."</p>

<p>"Would you that I should avow something worse to you? What
made me tolerate that poor Lagrange is that she was as ugly as the
seven cardinal sins.... In fine, I cannot conceal from myself that
the result of all this was that Mdlle. Lagrange gave up her situation on
the plea of ill-health. ["Ah! she was not dismissed," said Mdlle. Reuter
(Madame H&eacute;ger) in <i>The Professor</i>, Chapter XVIII., when the Professor
asked whether Mdlle. Frances Henri<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> (Miss Bront&euml;) had left voluntarily.
"... No need to have recourse to such extreme measures, I assure
you."] Enfin, it faut bien me l'avouer, le r&eacute;sultat de tout ceci a &eacute;t&eacute; que
Mademoiselle Lagrange a demand&eacute; &agrave; quitter la maison, sous pr&eacute;texte de
sant&eacute;; v&eacute;ritable pr&eacute;texte. For the rest I will do myself this justice, I
would have suffered even to the end rather than have sent back that
excellent girl."</p></div>

<p>The H&eacute;gers were surprised at Miss Bront&euml;'s sudden resolution to
leave them, but she is said to have had her father's failing eyesight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
as a reason. "I suffered much before I left Brussels," wrote
Charlotte, and this was in mind, not body.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have long concealed the greater part of these resentful sentiments
from you," continues Madame de Morville, "notwithstanding the
implicit trust reposed in you. I wish I alone had suffered by them. But
no, poor Lagrange doubtless could not endure the thousand vexations and
spites ('taquineries sournoises') to which she was subjected, and was
thereby driven from our house."</p></div>

<p>All this should be read as in connection with the departure of
Miss Mary, the other phase of Miss Bront&euml;, towards the end of the
book. "I think, however long I live I shall not forget what the
parting with M. H&eacute;ger cost me," said Charlotte Bront&euml;.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Here is M. Sue's version:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>M. de Morville started, then regarding the governess with stupor, for
he could not believe what he heard, he cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Quoi! Miss Mary, vous dites?"</p>

<p>"I say, monsieur, that I return to England, where I am recalled by
my family."</p></div>

<p>The real reason why Miss Bront&euml; left is given in the Lagrange
passages to which I have alluded.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Partir! but that is impossible! A departure so brusque, si peu
attendu!"</p>

<p>"Pray do not perceive, monsieur," says the Irish governess, "in this
unlooked for departure any want of regard for you; ... il a fallu des
raisons graves, very grave, to compel me to such a resolution."</p>

<p>"Partir!" wailed M. de Morville. "What! that this should be the
last time that I should see you, that I should speak to you! But this is
not possible! They do not kill a man thus by a single blow! For you
well know that you kill me! You well know that I love you! Oh! do
not say you were unaware of my unhappy love," he continues, "you know
well enough what an irresistible charm has drawn me towards you, what
happiness I have had to tell you my life, my secret thoughts, my wrongs
even! A timid reserve followed the first entrancement, but it was the
struggle of respect, of honour against a fatal passion. Ah! the traces of
that struggle, should they not have been too evident to your eyes! What!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
have not you divined the cause of that sombre discouragement which
made me seek solitude where I isolated myself from all interests, from all
affection? And those nights without sleep passed in consuming my tears,
exaggerating more the consequences of that fatal passion!... What!
you have divined nothing, read nothing of mes traits, in my eyes red
with tears and sleeplessness? Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! to have suffered
so much ... suffered so much, and not to have even the consolation of
saying: She knows that I have suffered."</p></div>

<p>The reader of <i>Miss Mary</i> will perceive throughout this scene in
the extant and apparently re-written French volume that M. de
Morville's unhappy love was that of an honourable and a loyal-hearted
man, while the governess was also without reproach. (These
extracts do not occur in the <i>feuilleton</i> as published in English.)
As he asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Is it my fault if in the monotony of my existence est tout &agrave; coup
apparue a person whose talents, education, and character have been
appreciated by all and by me.... Have I attempted to pervert your
mind, to seduce your heart? No, no! I have suffered, suffered in silence
[see my reference to the <i>Imitation of Christ</i>], suffered alone, suffered
always. And my crime, what is it?... It is to make to you the avowal
of suffering on the day when you go to leave me for ever a prey to incurable
despair!"</p></div>

<p>Thus have we real insight into the state of affairs at Brussels
when Miss Bront&euml; left. We see the divining, jealous Madame
de Morville&mdash;Madame H&eacute;ger, of course&mdash;subjecting her to the
"taquineries sournoises"; we hear Madame saying of her: "Ce que
me faisait tol&eacute;rer cette pauvre Mdlle. Lagrange, c'est qu'elle &eacute;tait
laide comme les sept p&eacute;ch&eacute;s mortels," and sneering at the excuse
she made to leave the establishment, calling it a "v&eacute;ritable pr&eacute;texte"
when the real reason was Madame's jealousy and its causes. Oh, the
bitterness of it! And now in this light read the carefully worded
representation of Mrs Gaskell that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Towards the end of 1843 various reasons conspired ... to make her
[Charlotte Bront&euml;] feel that her presence was absolutely and imperatively
required at home, while she was ... no longer regarded with the former
kindliness of feeling by Madame H&eacute;ger. In consequence of this state of
things working down with a sharp edge into a sensitive mind, she
suddenly announced to that lady her immediate intention of returning to
England.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Something of the foregoing I gave in my article "The Lifting of
the Bront&euml; Veil" in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>, and I have to thank
the press generally for their kind acknowledgment of my important
discovery. <i>The Spectator</i>, in consonance with others, says:&mdash;"Mr.
Malham-Dembleby has found a <i>feuilleton</i> by Eug&egrave;ne Sue which is
curious, as it certainly indicates a knowledge of Charlotte Bront&euml;
and of Monsieur and Madame H&eacute;ger at Brussels."</p>

<p>In the extant French copy Eug&egrave;ne Sue has given a dramatic
version of the parting scene between "Miss Mary" and "Madame
de Morville"&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml; and Madame H&eacute;ger. The latter
had surprised her husband and the Irish governess, <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> in
the lonely pavilion, late in the evening. Monsieur protests:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Madame," he cries, "... I will not permit you, in my presence,
to dare to calumniate and outrage Mademoiselle Lawson."</p>

<p>Miss Mary asks him not to defend her, as she does not wish to be a
cause of irritating discussion between them.</p>

<p>"That is charming!" cried Madame de Morville, with a burst of
sardonic laughter&mdash;"Gr&acirc;ce au bon accord du m&eacute;nage, mademoiselle
would desire to continue in perfect tranquillity the undignified r&ocirc;le she
has played at my house!"</p></div>

<p>Her husband protests that she outrages one of the purest
characters in the world, but the governess interrupts by addressing
the wife:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Madam, suspicions so odious, so senseless, are unable to wound an
honourable soul.... I reply nothing to these words, which you will
soon regret. The two years that I have been here [Charlotte Bront&euml;
was two years with the H&eacute;gers] I have learned to know you, madam; and
if sometimes I have without complaint [see the Lagrange passages]
suffered from the vivacit&eacute; de vos premiers mouvements, I have also often
been able to appreciate your goodness of heart."</p>

<p>"Enough, mademoiselle, enough! Believe you that you can dupe me by
your hypocrisies and base flatteries? Do you think you can impose my
silence by that pretended resignation?"</p></div>

<p>So the scene continues until Madame de Morville accuses the
other of wishing to take the affections of her husband. To this, the
governess retorts:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You accuse me, madam, of wishing to win the affections of M. de
Morville, and of desiring to dominate at your house? Here is my
reply."</p></div>

<p class="noidt">And her reply is that she is returning to England.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You go away!" cried Madame de Morville.... "No, no, that is a
lie or a trick!"... Madame ... fut compl&egrave;tement d&eacute;rout&eacute;e par
l'annonce du d&eacute;part de Miss Mary.</p></div>

<p>The latter says she profoundly regrets if she had caused
"malheurs," for she had been the involuntary cause.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Involuntary or not," cried Madame de Morville, "you are un <i>porte-malheur</i>,
and thus have been two years, since your arrival here. I have
said it to M. de Morville, who, par pr&eacute;vision without doubt, took at once
your part against me.... And on whom, then, will that responsibility
fall!... We were all happy and peaceful before your advent here, and
to-day, when you go you leave us dans le chagrin."</p>

<p>To which Miss Mary retorts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! madame, le jour le plus malheureux de ma vie serait celui o&ugrave; je
quitterais votre famille avec la douloureuse conviction que mon nom y
serait maudit."</p></div>

<p>There were, we see, conflicting views in Brussels social and
literary circles, in the eighteen-forties, as to the degree of intimacy
to which Charlotte Bront&euml; and M. H&eacute;ger attained. It is when we
perceive the ambiguity of the relations existing between Miss Bront&euml;
and the professor that we recognize the fidelity of Eug&egrave;ne Sue's
portrayal of Currer Bell's Brussels life. Even Charlotte Bront&euml;
herself, in <i>Villette</i>, published after M. Sue's story, relates that
M. Paul Emanuel (M. H&eacute;ger) said to her:&mdash;"I call myself your
brother. I hardly know what I am&mdash;brother&mdash;friend&mdash;I cannot tell.
I know I think of you&mdash;I feel I wish you well&mdash;but I must check
myself; you are to be feared. My best friends point out danger
and whisper caution." In Mdlle. Lagrange and Catherine Bell,
Charlotte Bront&euml; figures as represented by those who said ill of her;
as Miss Mary Lawson, the Irish governess, she has "beauty, youth,
and grace," which charms, Jane tells us, she possessed in
Rochester's eyes. Of her, in the phase of Catherine Bell, we
have many insinuations of a detractive character, the keynote to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
which is found in the fortune-telling incident, wherein Catherine is
foretold she will be "married and not married"; while in Miss Mary
Lawson we have a portrayal of <i>un bon ange</i><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of whom Madame
de Morville is jealous, not without reason, though, to use Miss
Mary's own words, she had been "la cause involontaire."</p>

<p>We must, therefore, set it to the credit of Eug&egrave;ne Sue that he
placed two versions in the balance; and his evidence for ever sweeps
away the illogical and unfair contention of some writers on the
Bront&euml;s, that Charlotte Bront&euml; may have cared for M. H&eacute;ger, but
that he, in his turn, had been only "intellectually" interested in her.
M. Sue shows the attitude of M. H&eacute;ger was ever unequivocal as
regards Charlotte Bront&euml;; whether in her phase as "Lagrange," as
"Catherine Bell," or as "Miss Mary Lawson"&mdash;she was loved by
him. We now see Morton of <i>Jane Eyre</i> was Haworth to Charlotte
Bront&euml;, and Thornfield, the home of Mr. Rochester, the Pensionnat
H&eacute;ger. And the flight from temptation at Thornfield and
seeking refuge with the Rivers family were really representative of
her leaving Brussels and returning home to her father and sisters.
Obviously M. Sue wrote his <i>feuilleton</i> to aid, maliciously or not, in
breaking the dangerous friendship between M. H&eacute;ger and Miss
Bront&euml;. Charlotte Bront&euml;'s works are testimony it was not only
Madame H&eacute;ger's harsh jealousy that led her to leave Brussels. In
Chapter XX. of <i>The Professor</i>, published years after M. Sue's work,
but written before it, she gives us the reason for this determination.
By her Method I., Interchange of the sexes of characters portrayed
from life, Professor Crimsworth, who is alternately Charlotte Bront&euml;
and M. H&eacute;ger, in this instance is Charlotte Bront&euml;, while Mdlle.
Reuter is M. H&eacute;ger. Crimsworth [Miss Bront&euml;] says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I could not conceal ... that it would not do for me to remain....
Her [his] present demeanour towards me was deficient neither in
dignity nor propriety; but I knew her [his] former feeling was unchanged.
Decorum now repressed, and Policy masked it, but Opportunity would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
be too strong for either of these&mdash;Temptation would shiver their restraints.
I was no pope, ... in short, if I stayed, the probability was that, in three
months' time, a practical modern French novel would be in full process of
concoction.... From all this resulted the conclusion that I must leave,
... and that instantly.... The Spirit of Evil ... sought to lead me
astray.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Rough and steep was the path indicated by divine suggestion;
mossy and declining the green way along which Temptation strewed
flowers.</p></div>

<p>And thus at last do we understand why Charlotte Bront&euml; asks
herself as Jane Eyre when at home with the Rivers family&mdash;with her
father, her sisters, and Tabby at Haworth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Which is better? To have surrendered to temptation; listened
to passion; made no painful effort&mdash;no struggle; but to have sunk down
in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it ... to have
been now living in France, Mr. Rochester's mistress ... I shall never
more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace&mdash;for
never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms.... Whether
is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles&mdash;fevered
with delusive bliss one hour&mdash;suffocating with the bitterest tears of
remorse and shame the next&mdash;or to be a village schoolmistress [The
Bront&euml; school project was under contemplation in 1844], free and honest,
in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England? Yes, I feel
now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and crushed
the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God directed me to a
correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance.</p></div>

<p>And her fervent gratitude is as sincere when in the same connection
she says in <i>Villette</i> of her confessor&mdash;her F&eacute;nelon<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>:&mdash;"He
was kind when I needed kindness; he did me good. May
Heaven bless him!" But we now see Charlotte Bront&euml; did not
suffer alone. Eug&egrave;ne Sue has given us an insight into the bitterness
of M. de Morville's (M. H&eacute;ger's) life, which resulted from their
unhappy love, and doubtless those words of Heathcliffe to Catherine
in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> were uttered or written by M. H&eacute;ger in
reproach to Charlotte Bront&euml;:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Why</i> did you despise me? <i>Why</i> did you betray your own heart,
Cathy?... You loved me&mdash;then what <i>right</i> had you to leave me?...
Because misery and degradation and death, and nothing that God or
Satan could inflict would have parted us, <i>you</i>, of your own will did it. I
have not broken your heart&mdash;<i>you</i> have broken it; and in breaking it, you
have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong."</p></div>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; tells us in <i>Jane Eyre</i> she loved to imagine she
and Mr. Rochester had met under happier conditions; and if the
meeting of the runaway lovers Charlotte Bront&euml; repeats so faithfully
in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> did not refer to a private
meeting subsequent to the beginning of 1844, between her and
M. H&eacute;ger, or to their meeting again when she returned to Brussels
the second time, then have we evidence of the fact that she at one
time perhaps believed <i>Wuthering Heights</i> would be never published.
Assuredly nothing was sweeter to Currer Bell's fancy than a
dream of the happiness that might have been hers, and well may she
have written in the last sentences of <i>Villette</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Leave sunny imaginations hope. Let it be theirs to conceive the
delight of joy born again fresh out of great terror, the rapture of rescue
from peril, the wondrous reprieve from dread, the fruition of return. Let
them picture union and a happy succeeding life.</p></div>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; and M. Constantin Gilles Romain H&eacute;ger loved
each other as those who are worshippers of two high ideals, when
one of these ideals is love, the other honour. And this was tragedy.
To the agonizing nature of unrequitable affection endured for
honour's sake do we owe Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
and <i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

<h3>THE RECOIL.</h3>

<h3><b>I.</b></h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> elements that conduce to reaction and recoil are sometimes
fatal to the best proposed and ablest evolved schemes of man.
Priests and counsellors may gravely devise; knight and maid may
devoutly swear; the pious neophyte and the exalted religionist may
make solemn pledge, but reaction often brings catastrophe. Thus
the Christian Church is rightfully a watchful Body, a militant Force,
preaches the weakness of man and cries "Ora continenter!" And
herein lies the value of a ponderous state procedure. Irritating in
its slow gravity and indifferent to the passionate appeals of emotionalism,
such procedure yet withstands the backward wave which comes
as answer to courageous but costly proposals.</p>

<p>The unsupported and undisciplined individual, like communities,
cannot always safely stand alone, and finally resolves into an
automaton at the service of unlicensed and unconsidered impulse
when the day of reaction comes. The anthropologist and the
pathologist relate how exacting straitness suddenly has broken
down with a lamentable demonstration of most morbid prurience;
and relentless history has chronicled grievous moral declensions in
the lives of men and women whose careers in the greater part were
records of generous and unselfish devotion to a noble cause or an
honourable work. Until the day of reaction is safely fought through
the battle is not won.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was to prevent all possibility of a final and definite
reconciliation between M. H&eacute;ger and Miss Bront&euml; that M. Sue,
aided by his friends, ridiculed their attachment in his <i>feuilleton,
Miss Mary</i>. Not that Eug&egrave;ne Sue would do this necessarily for
Virtue's sake, but the position of moral reprehender gave him title to
the r&ocirc;le he had assumed. M. H&eacute;ger was sorely punished to lose
Miss Bront&euml;, as M. Sue has shown, and as we have seen Charlotte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Bront&euml; herself tells us in a letter; and the intensity of his affection
for her is only further accentuated by the light M. Sue throws upon
the subject in a conversation which occurs between Alphonsine and
the jealous mother, concerning Mdlle. Lagrange in the opening
chapters of his <i>feuilleton</i>. As I have stated, evidence compels us to
perceive M. Sue often presented by imitation of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
Method I., Interchange of the sexes for obfuscation's sake,
M. H&eacute;ger in Alphonsine: Madame de Morville (Madame H&eacute;ger)
has just said Mdlle. Lagrange (Miss Bront&euml;) affected a little to speak
of her humble origin.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Elle affecter," replies Alphonsine, "... c'est une erreur. Quand,
par hasard, elle parlait de sa famille, c'est que la conversation venait
l&agrave;-dessus. D'ailleurs, &eacute;coute donc, Mademoiselle Lagrange e&ucirc;t &eacute;t&eacute; fi&egrave;re
qu'elle en avait le droit."</p>

<p>"Proud! what of? not of her face, poor girl."</p>

<p>"No, that is true."</p></div>

<p>Madame de Morville admits that Mdlle. Lagrange was endowed
with patience, learning, and fortitude; and says, "Tu le sais, nous
avions pour elle les plus grands &eacute;gards."</p>

<p>"Without doubt ... and myself, I loved her like a sister."</p>

<p>To which Madame de Morville retorts:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A ce point que, pendant les premiers jours qui ont suivi son d&eacute;part
je t'ai vue souvent pleurer, et que depuis je te trouve triste."</p>

<p>"Que veux-tu ... se quitter apr&egrave;s plus de trois ans d'intimit&eacute;, cela
vous laisse du chagrin."</p>

<p>"This sensibility does credit to your heart, but after all it seems to
me that you and I shall be able by our mutual tenderness to console
each other for the loss d'une &eacute;trang&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"Une &eacute;trang&egrave;re!" says Alphonsine, na&iuml;vely; "dis donc une amie,
une soeur.... Ainsi, toi ... tu es pour moi, n'est-ce pas, aussi affectueuse
que possible; pourtant tu m'imposes toujours; il y a mille riens,
mille folies, mille b&ecirc;tises si tu veux, que je n'oserais jamais te dire, et
qui nous amusaient et nous faisaient rire aux larmes avec cette pauvre
Mademoiselle Lagrange; et puis ces causeries sans fin pendant les
r&eacute;cr&eacute;ations, nos jeux m&ecirc;mes, car elle &eacute;tait tr&egrave;s enfant quand elle s'y
mettait<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; all this made our temps de l'&eacute;tude pass like a dream, and that
of recreation like a flash."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>"Without doubt," replied Madame de Morville, with a forced smile;
... "and I, ... je ne jouissais de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de ces demoiselles que
lors de notre promenade d'avant d&icirc;ner, ou le soir jusqu'&agrave; l'heure du th&eacute;."</p></div>

<p>The irreparableness of the loss at first to M. H&eacute;ger is herein
clearly shown. But whether he would confess himself to Miss
Bront&euml; afterwards is not certain. The tone of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
successive writings suggests he did not, as do many points of
evidence and the reference in <i>Villette</i>, Chapter XIX., to that "He
was a religious little man, in his way: the self-denying and self-sacrificing
part of the Catholic religion commanded the homage of
his soul."</p>

<p>Likely enough it is that M. H&eacute;ger hailed, as do truly noble
men, the day of trial, and elevated by the very agony of great
sacrifice the personality which worshipped a conception of duty
consonant with Divine law. It seems, though, that then the battle
was won; his day of reaction was fought through. At the time of
what M. Sue makes M. de Morville call "ce premier entra&icirc;nement"
was the greatest danger, and abundant testimony goes to prove he
would have gone the length of indiscretion but that Charlotte
Bront&euml;, herself innately honourable and influenced by her Christian
upbringing, checked the mad rush of impetuous passion. Then
the Church of M. H&eacute;ger intervened. As Charlotte Bront&euml; tells us
in <i>Villette</i>, Chapter XXXVI.: "We were under the surveillance of
a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously her son through that
mystic lattice at which I had knelt once, and to which M. Emanuel
drew nigh month by month&mdash;the sliding panel of the confessional."
She was much gratified by M. H&eacute;ger's fervent admiration, though
she had perforce to remember their circumstances. As M. Sue
said of Lagrange so it had been with Miss Bront&euml;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The girl had never before known love, save by reading and hearing
of its magical influence. All the natural tenderness which lay in her
heart she had year after year suppressed.</p></div>

<p>The references in her poems to a recognition of growing coldness
in a lover&mdash;see "Frances," "Preference," etc., if we may read
them in the biographical sense Mr. Mackay suggests, show there had
been a day when she perceived external influences were dictating to
M. H&eacute;ger a line of moral procedure. Obviously, while she herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
had held temptation at bay she was strong; but once she discovered
an ally was lessening the necessity of her defence her woman's nature
awoke. She doubted the sincerity of the past protestations of
passion; she saw in every eye a sinister spy; she found in the Roman
Church nothing but a partisan of Madame H&eacute;ger (see Madame Beck
and the Roman Church in <i>Villette</i>), and M. H&eacute;ger became to her a
very impersonation of insincerity and treachery. Of the secret
tempest which had begun to rage within herself she would disclose
nothing to M. H&eacute;ger; and she would know that once the storm slept
the end might be the worst. But Charlotte Bront&euml; was not yet in
the season of the recoil, though alone, wretched, and rapidly losing
faith in God and man. As for M. H&eacute;ger, he was supported by the
knowledge that the ideal of the good and pious is glorified by
sacrifice. That "Hell holds no fury like a woman scorned" is a
platitude, for a woman scorned in the meaning of the writer is a
woman with a shattered life. In her fullest and native sense she
ceases to exist thereafter. However, as in many cases Nature
provides a remedy for her maimed, woman has given her dissimulation.
But to quote Charlotte Bront&euml;'s poem, "Frances":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="noidt">It is a dangerous day when woman is her very self and thwarted.
Then, and only then, can she utter the distressing blasphemies
Charlotte Bront&euml; places in the mouth of the speaker in her verses,
"Apostasy":&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noidt">And places in the mouth of Catherine of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,
Chapter IX., in the same connection:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If I were in heaven ... I should be extremely miserable.... I
dreamt once ... I was there, ... heaven did not seem to be my
home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and
the angels were so angry that they flung me out ... on the top of
Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> ... I cannot
express it; but surely you ... have a notion that there is ... an
existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation if I
were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have
been Heathcliffe's miseries ... my great thought in living is himself.
If all else perished, and <i>he</i> remained, I should still continue to be; and if
all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a
mighty stranger. I should not seem a part of it. [See my remarks on
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s belief in the elective affinities, page 96-7.] My love for
Heathcliffe resembles the eternal rocks beneath.... I <i>am</i> Heathcliffe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>&mdash;he's
always, always in my mind&mdash;not as a pleasure, any more than I
am a pleasure to myself&mdash;but as my own being&mdash;so don't talk of our
separation again."</p></div>

<p>It is of the barriers which divided the woman of the verses
"Apostasy" from her lover that the priest has reminded her. Thus
she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... Did I need that thou shouldst tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mighty barriers rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To part me from that dungeon-cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where my loved Walter lies?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">The whole history of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Brussels life before us, the
fact that an insurmountable barrier&mdash;his marriage&mdash;separated her
from M. H&eacute;ger, and the fact that she herself consulted<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> a Roman
Catholic priest whom I designate as her "F&eacute;n&eacute;lon," advising, like
the Mentor of T&eacute;l&eacute;maque,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the tempted one to "flee temptation,"
identify these "barriers" as a covert reference to the circumstances
unhappily existing which made intimacy between Miss Bront&euml; and
M. H&eacute;ger dangerous. To quote my words in <i>The Fortnightly
Review</i>:&mdash;"We see why Miss Bront&euml;, herself a Protestant, went to
the confessional at Brussels.... We know this was no freak, as
also that it was impossible for Charlotte to mention the subject to
her sister without attributing it to a freak. More, we perceive now
the nature of her confession, and, the "Flee temptation!" note of
F&eacute;n&eacute;lon's <i>Les Aventures de T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i> fresh in our minds, we see
why she wrote of her father-confessor in <i>Villette</i>, Chapter XV.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There was something of F&eacute;nelon about that benign old priest; and
whatever ... I may think of his Church and creed, ... of himself I
must ever retain a grateful recollection. He was kind when I needed
kindness; he did me good. May heaven bless him!</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>I mention that by her composite method of presenting characters,
which Charlotte Bront&euml; admitted to have employed, Dr. John
Bretton, while often in the beginning representing Mr. Smith the
publisher, becomes finally a representation of the Rev. Mr. Nicholls
who married Miss Bront&euml;.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> So in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, St. John Rivers while
in the main representing the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;, becomes associated
temporarily with that priest I have called Charlotte Bront&euml;'s Brussels
F&eacute;n&eacute;lon. She tells us in <i>Villette</i> that she broke off the seduction of
visiting this priest and says:&mdash;"The probabilities are that had
I visited ... at the ... day appointed, I might just now ... have
been counting my beads in the cell of a ... convent...." Miss
Bront&euml; admits he had had great influence with her, and this fact and
the testimony of her poem "Apostasy" just quoted show this priest
and his admonitions were in her mind when she wrote the final
scene between herself and St. John Rivers in <i>Jane Eyre</i> (Chapter
XXXV.). Therein, as in that poem and in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,
"Religion" and "Angels"<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> are set as being less to her than the
vicinage of her lover. Indeed the India and the missionary life of
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, and the marriage with St. John (see Chapter XXXIV.),
may be said to have been in Miss Bront&euml;'s mind that life of religious
consecration which in <i>Villette</i> she owns to have been the likely result
of her further listening to the advice of the priest, to whom she had
given "the ... outline of my experience," as she terms it.</p>

<p>Therefore it is interesting to observe that, as the woman in
"Apostasy" suddenly hears the voice of her lover calling and says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He calls&mdash;I come&mdash;my pulse scarce beats,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My heart fails in my breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again that voice&mdash;how far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How dreary sounds that tone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, methinks, am gone astray<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In trackless wastes and lone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I fain would rest a little while:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where can I find a stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till dawn upon the hills shall smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And show some trodden way?<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span><span class="i0">I come! I come! in haste she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Twas Walter's voice I heard!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up she sprang&mdash;but fell back, dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His name her latest word.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">so in the scene in <i>Jane Eyre</i>: St. John ejaculates&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'My prayers are heard!' He pressed his hand firmer on my head, as
if he claimed me; he surrounded me with his arm, <i>almost</i> as if he loved
me ["That priest had arms which could influence me; he was naturally
kind, with a sentimental French kindness, to whose softness I knew
myself not wholly impervious. Without respecting some sorts of affection,
there was hardly any sort having a fibre of root in reality, which I could
rely on my force wholly to withstand."&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml; speaking of her
Brussels F&eacute;n&eacute;lon in <i>Villette</i>, Chapter XV.], I say <i>almost</i>&mdash;I knew the
difference&mdash;for I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I now
... thought only of duty;... I sincerely, ... fervently longed to do
what was right.... 'Show me, show me the path!' I entreated of
Heaven.... My heart beat fast and thick.... I heard a voice somewhere
cry 'Jane! Jane! Jane!' nothing more.... I had heard it&mdash;where
or whence, for ever impossible to know! And it was ... a known,
loved, well-remembered voice&mdash;that of Edward Fairfax Rochester.... 'I am
coming!' I cried.... 'Wait for me! Oh, I will come!' I broke from St.
John, who would have detained me. It was <i>my</i> time to assume ascendency.
<i>My</i> powers were in play, and in force. I told him to forbear
question or remark.... I mounted to my chamber ... fell on my knees,
and prayed in my way&mdash;a different way to St. John's, but effective in its
own fashion.... I rose from the thanksgiving&mdash;took a resolve&mdash;and lay
down ... eager but for the daylight.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell related that Charlotte Bront&euml; in private conversation
in reference to this preternatural crying of a voice, replied with
much gravity and without further enlightenment that such an incident
really did occur in her experience. Whether it occurred
in connection with her Brussels F&eacute;n&eacute;lon and immediately preceded
a reconciliation between herself and M. H&eacute;ger I know not. As,
however, Charlotte Bront&euml;'s expression of gratitude to this priest and
the whole fervent story of thankfulness for the deliverance from
dangerous temptation were written subsequently to her return from
Brussels, it is clear there was never a reconciliation which cost either
her or M. H&eacute;ger honour. I do not urge this as an advocate; I state
it upon the strength of unmistakable evidence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Bront&euml; believed it better to leave Brussels and avoid the
possibilities of the peculiar situation&mdash;a situation always fraught with
temptation. Hence her sudden resolve to return to England.</p>

<p>Arrived at Haworth the full recoil came. She had won through
a great ordeal, and she knew that surrounded by his wife and family,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
comforted by piety and the knowledge of his happy issue from
involution in disastrous complications, M. H&eacute;ger would resume
tranquilly his accustomed course of life. To Charlotte Bront&euml;, who
by the showing of all evidence was initially responsible for a morally
gratifying outcome of their dangerous attachment, this was a galling
picture. Knowing nothing of the ecstatic delights of the pietist in
the sacrificial sense of M. H&eacute;ger, who was a devoted member of the
Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and, as he is made to describe himself
in <i>Villette</i>, "a sort of lay Jesuit," she became just a woman
living in the world of her primal nature and conceiving but that she
had lost. Miss Rigby&mdash;afterwards Lady Eastlake&mdash;who wrote the
remarkable article on <i>Jane Eyre</i> in <i>The Quarterly Review</i> of 1849,
perceived with a flash of real insight and the instinct of womanhood
that Currer Bell's pen had presented ungarbed, vital relations of some
man and woman identical in both <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>.
The circumstances were full difficult for the reviewer; she was
irritated and encompassed. <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, which so soon had
followed the appearance of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, she suddenly recognized as
the very storm-centre of this literary tornado of passionate declamation;
and she chastised that work in the name of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, for she
could not know all the cruel truth, and she feared to popularize
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Although Miss Rigby wrote:&mdash;"It is true Jane
does right, and exerts great moral strength," she added, "but it is the
strength of a mere heathenish mind which is a law unto itself." And
later, turning upon <i>Wuthering Heights</i> she says with a final vehemency,
and most sensationally:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There can be no interest attached to the writer of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>&mdash;a novel succeeding <i>Jane Eyre</i> ... and purporting [!] to be
written by Ellis Bell&mdash;unless it were for the sake of a more individual
reprobation. For though there is a decided family likeness between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
two [!], yet the aspect of the Jane and Rochester animals in their native
state as Catherine and Heathcliffe [!], is abominably pagan.</p></div>

<p>Miss Rigby thus excused herself a further consideration of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>. In the days of the gratification of discovering
the one she loved in return loved her,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> this recognition stood between
Charlotte Bront&euml; and "every thought of religion, as an eclipse
between man and the broad sun," so in another sense truly did the
contemplation of M. H&eacute;ger's self-pacification intervene in the time of
reaction. The doubtings and agonizing emotions of her equivocal
season in Brussels were now precipitated. Her poems "Gilbert,"
"Frances," and "Preference" are testimony to her vengeful and retaliative
instinct; as are her portrayals of M. H&eacute;ger as M. Pelet of <i>The
Professor</i> and as Heathcliffe of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. But as I show
in the next chapter, Charlotte Bront&euml; afterwards regretted her human
weakness and her vituperations of the day of the recoil. She began
to set forth the story of her ordeal more sanely and proportionately
in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. As one who soberly rewrites of fact, she recited
therein much that she already had given detachedly; and consistently
she presented by aid of the frame-work of "plot" from
Montagu's <i>Gleanings in Craven</i> which already had given her
elemental suggestions for her <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, the history of her
life in <i>Jane Eyre</i>&mdash;a work that stands as testimony to Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s love of truth as to her heroic battling in the days of fiercest
temptation.</p>

<p>A constant yearning to fine a presentation from untruthfulness is
the God-given attribute of the artist, and this was responsible for
much that is called harsh in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s character as a writer:
she would not even spare her own physical and nervous imperfections
in her self-portrayals. Emily Bront&euml; would have presented Branwell
Bront&euml; as viewed through <i>couleur de rose</i>, yet Charlotte Bront&euml; immortalized
him as Hindley Earnshaw and John Reed&mdash;as she saw
him: weak, tyrannical, a moral wreck. So she presented M. H&eacute;ger.
She knew his faults&mdash;and they were many; but she loved him though
she hated them. Her sense of truth and justice, albeit she had lost
the rancour of the time of the reaction, determined her in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
it is obvious, to show the occultation of her life's happiness by the
incidents of her Brussels life. She would show there had been a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
day when the barriers between them would have been rashly
ignored by him. Thus Rochester is made to sing in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
Chap. XXIV.:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is clear the impediment of M. H&eacute;ger's marriage is suggested in
these verses. But undeniable evidence as to Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
having escaped by flight what she considered a most dangerous
temptation, is the fact that we find she was influenced to pen these
lines, wherein M. H&eacute;ger (Rochester) is likened to a wild pursuer of
a "shower and gleam" nymph who sped before him "fast as light"
and "glorious rose upon his sight," by Montagu's reference, in
<i>Gleanings in Craven</i>, to the story of a Craven nymph a satyr pursued
yet lost by her being changed into a spring. Says Frederic
Montagu:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the <i>Polyolbion</i>, published in 1612, is the following passage:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In all my spacious tract let them (so wise) survey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Ribble's rising banks, their worst and let them say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Giggleswick, where I a fountain can you show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That eight times in a day is said to ebb and flow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sometime was a Nymph, and in the mountains high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Craven, whose blue heads, for caps put on the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the Oreads there, and Sylvans, made abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(It was ere human foot upon these hills had trod),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the mountain kind, and since she was most fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a Satyr's chance to see her silver hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flow loosely at her back, as up a cliff she clame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beauties noting well, her features and her frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after her he goes; which when she did espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him like the wind, the nimble Nymph did fly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hurry down the rocks, o'er hill and dale they drive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take her he doth strain, t' outstrip him she doth strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one his kind that knew, and greatly feared....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the Topic Gods by praying to escape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turned her to a Spring, which as she then did pant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, wearied with her course, her breath grew wond'rous scant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as the fearful Nymph, then thick and short did blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now made by them a Spring, so doth she ebb and flow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">This is not all. We know now the truth regarding Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s Brussels life, and seeing she discovered a pertinence in
the state of the Craven Nymph to her own&mdash;for it is undeniable
Rochester's song was modelled upon the lines Montagu quotes&mdash;it
is likely that what I term the "river" suggestion and the Craven
Elf suggestion which resulted in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s portraying herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in the r&ocirc;le of the stream-named Craven elf, Janet Aire or Eyre, had
to do with Montagu's mention of this nymph of Craven who escaped
a dangerous persecution by becoming a spring. It seems, indeed,
that if she did not at first utilize the parallel of this narrative in verse
with her own experience, she yet in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> was influenced
by it, in the days which I call the period of the recoil, to represent
her hero Heathcliffe as a ruin-creating, semi-human being. Whether
the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>It is now impossible not to understand the origin of the Satyr

<h3><span class="smcap">The Recoil.</span></h3>

<h3><b>II.</b></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have
been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused; ... the same ridge,
black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as
meetly my subsequent condition when ... reflection had shown me the
madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating
position. Something of vengeance I had tasted.... As aromatic wine
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy; its after-flavour, metallic and
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.... I would
fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking&mdash;fain
find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
indignation.</p></div>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">These</span> words, written by Charlotte Bront&euml; in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chapter IV.,
in relation to herself and "Mrs. Reed," give us an insight into her
extraordinary alternations of mood. To inquire deeply into her
determining initially to disavow the authorship of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> requires a somewhat ruthless baring of the "fiendish"
vindictiveness against M. H&eacute;ger between the dates of 1844-46,
that was a characteristic of the portrayals of him I have
mentioned; but it also reveals her active turn to a spirit of
repentance for past vindictive feeling, the which she acknowledges
to have known.</p>

<p>It seems that it was in a spirit of reproach Charlotte Bront&euml;
wrote the vengeful scene between Heathcliffe and Catherine in
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, harsh in threat almost as her poem "Gilbert,"
wherein the man, satisfied with the affections of his wife and children,
has banished the remembrance of her of whom he boasted&mdash;"She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
loved me more than life," and who is made to say, before her spirit
in the form of a white-clad spectre comes to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As I am busied now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not turn from such pursuit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To weep a broken vow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Thus in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Chapter XV., when Catherine is
embraced by Heathcliffe, she says bitterly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I wish I could hold you till we were both dead! I shouldn't care
what you suffered. I care nothing for your sufferings. Why shouldn't
you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I am
in the earth? Will you say ... 'That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw.
I loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is past.
I've loved many others since: my children are dearer to me than she
was; and at death, I shall not rejoice that I am going to her; I shall be
sorry that I must lose them!' Will you say so, Heathcliffe?" Well
might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless
with her mortal body she cast away her mortal character also. [See my
footnote in the foregoing chapter, on Catherine's dream that the angels
flung her out of heaven.] Her present countenance had a wild
vindictiveness....</p>

<p>"Are you possessed with a devil," he pursued savagely, "to talk in
that manner to me when you are dying?"</p></div>

<p>And later, as though in answer to the apparent threat of the
poem "Gilbert," wherein, as I have said, the spectre of the woman
who has died broken-hearted through the neglect of her married
lover haunts him and drives him mad, Heathcliffe, in the words of
that poem, "Wild as one whom demons seize," cries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Catherine Earnshaw ... you said I killed you&mdash;haunt me then!
The murdered <i>do</i> haunt their murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts
<i>have</i> wandered on earth. Be with me always&mdash;take any form&mdash;drive me
mad!"</p></div>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;'s poems, "Frances,"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> "Gilbert," and "Preference"
(wherein we have literature in allegory preferred to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
lover), show there had been to her a season of darkest misery when,
to quote <i>Villette</i> concerning herself as Lucy Snowe, "all her life's
hope was torn by the roots out of her riven outraged heart."
Whether this was the time when, in the words of herself as Jane
Eyre, "faith was blighted, confidence destroyed": a time to her
when Mr. Rochester (M. H&eacute;ger) was not to her "what she had
thought him," the reader shall decide. But in <i>Villette</i> and <i>Jane
Eyre</i> she "would not ascribe vice to him; ... would not say he
had betrayed" her. She forgave him all: yet not in words, not
outwardly; only at [her] heart's core. See the phase of M. Pelet
in the <i>The Professor</i>.</p>

<p>Evidence shows it was in her dark season when Charlotte Bront&euml;
wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and that she portrayed M. H&eacute;ger therein
with all the vindictiveness of a woman with "a riven outraged
heart," the wounds in which yet rankled sorely. Thus may we
understand her saying in her famous preface to <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Heathcliffe betrays one solitary human feeling, and that is <i>not</i> his
love for Catherine, which is a sentiment fierce and inhuman: a passion
such as might boil and glow in the bad essence of some evil genius [see
my reference to "Robin-a-Ree"; and to the Craven Satyr, page 142]; a
fire that might form the tormented centre&mdash;the ever-suffering soul of a
magnate of the infernal world: and by its quenchless and ceaseless
ravage effect the execution of the decree which dooms him to carry
Hell with him ... we should say he was a man's shape animated by
demon life.... Whether it is right or advisable to create a being like
Heathcliffe I do not know; I scarcely think it is.</p></div>

<p>Even in <i>Villette</i> there were recurrences of the spasmodic spirit
of vindictiveness responsible for Charlotte Bront&euml;'s harsh portrayal
of M. H&eacute;ger as Heathcliffe, though "at her heart's core she then
forgave him." In <i>Villette</i>, Chapter XX., she refers to M. Paul (M.
H&eacute;ger) antithetically, and all the more significantly, in a comparison
of him with Dr. John Bretton, of whom she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Who could help liking him? <i>He</i> betrayed no weakness which
harassed all your feelings with considerations as to how its faltering must
be propped; from <i>him</i> broke no irritability which startled calm and
quenched mirth; <i>his</i> lips let fall no caustic that burned to the bone; <i>his</i>
eye shot no morose shafts that went cold, and rusty, and venomed
through your heart.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i>, however, containing too humiliating a story
of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s heart-thrall, her misery and her wild vindictiveness,
and also for the reasons stated in the beginning of
this chapter&mdash;her saving remorse&mdash;she seems early to have
determined to repudiate her authorship of it; indeed, so largely
is she now found to have used the work in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, we
might say she once had contemplated destroying the manuscript.
The subsequent arrangement made in the name of Ellis Bell
that the work by the same author should go to Mr. Newby,
the publisher of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, gave finality to this tragedy
of authorship which, but for the discoveries in this, <i>The Key
to the Bront&euml; Works</i>, would have remained for ever unrevealed,
and a reproach to literature&mdash;a thing of untruth thickly
hidden.</p>

<p>Had Charlotte Bront&euml; destroyed <i>Wuthering Heights</i> before its
publication she would have saved this sensational disclosure. But
she hesitated to destroy the manuscript at once, and as an alternative
to identifying herself with its authorship, she sent forth her
work under a <i>nom de guerre</i>, part of which had been employed by
her sister Emily. We well know the difficulties that resulted; the
judgment of scholars and thinkers was impugned and their sane
pronouncements were pilloried. To cover Charlotte Bront&euml;'s regretful
error were to connive against law and literature. <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
being published, the work was the world's property; it stood for
public purposes, to submit to all criticism and research, and it
came neither in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s province nor in that of any
person to prevent its being subjected to the final inquiry with which
the cold light of truth exposes all things.</p>

<p>Doubtless Charlotte Bront&euml; perceived this, and regretting the
facileness of her pen and the vituperativeness of her mood of that
past and hateful night, she set herself, in her subsequent works, to
make clear she had overdrawn the bitterness of the relations which
one time had existed between herself and M. H&eacute;ger. Perhaps she
could not expect her retractions would be understood of all men,
but it pleased her inmost soul, and having a final sense of justice,
and a softening of her heart for her vehement passionateness, she
continued in all her works subsequent to her <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
to reconstruct this her early version. Thus Charlotte Bront&euml; as
Caroline Helstone of <i>Shirley</i> is Catherine Earnshaw of <i>Wuthering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Heights</i>, with the distinction I mention. Moore is admitted, as I
have said, to have been drawn from M. H&eacute;ger<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is in <i>Shirley</i> that Charlotte Bront&euml; gives, inadvertently or purposely,
the origin of the title of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and we see
therewith why she came afterwards to choose for her autobiographical-self
in <i>Villette</i>, the name of Lucy Snowe. We perceive she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>had been singularly impressed by an old Scottish ballad, entitled,
"Puir Mary Lee," and it is important and interesting to note that
Dr. Joseph Wright's <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i> refers readers to this
very same poem in connection with the origin of the northern word
"wuthering," in the form of the verb "whudder," or "wuther." And
so, in a letter to Mr. W. S. Williams, of November 6th, 1852,
Miss Bront&euml; wrote of Lucy Snowe<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As to the name of the heroine, I can hardly express what subtlety
of thought made me decide upon giving her a cold name; but at first I
called her 'Lucy Snowe' (spelt with an 'e'), which 'Snowe' I afterwards
changed to 'Frost.' Subsequently I rather regretted the change,
and wished it 'Snowe' again. If not too late, I should like the alteration
to be made now throughout the MS. A <i>cold</i> name she must have;
partly, perhaps on the <i>lucus a non lucendo</i> principle&mdash;partly on that of the
'fitness of things,' for she has about her an external coldness.</p></div>

<p>Thus we understand Charlotte Bront&euml; was anxious that her autobiographical-self
in <i>Villette</i> should be called Snowe. While, in
mentioning the matter to her publishers, she endeavoured to show a
superficial and commonplace reason for her singular choice, the
truth underlies her words wherein she says she "can hardly express
what subtlety of thought" made her decide upon "a cold name."</p>

<p>The subtlety of thought that dictated the choice of the "cold
name" Snowe had, we shall see, a connection with the old Scottish
ballad, "Puir Mary Lee," which evidence shows was responsible at
the dark season to which I have referred for Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
choice of the title of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>&mdash;for her identifying her own
bitterness with that of "Puir Mary Lee."</p>

<p>It is in <i>Shirley</i>, Chapter VII., that Charlotte Bront&euml; writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nature ... is an excellent friend, sealing the lips, interdicting
utterance, commanding a placid dissimulation; a dissimulation often
wearing an easy and gay mien at first, settling down to sorrow and
paleness in time, then passing away, and leaving a convenient stoicism,
not the less fortifying because half-bitter. [As Lucy Snowe, Charlotte
Bront&euml; writes in <i>Villette</i> in perfect sympathy with this: "If I feel, may I
never express? I groaned under her (Reason's) bitter sternness ... she
could not rest unless I were altogether crushed, cowed, broken-in, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
broken-down. According to her, I was born only to work for a piece of
bread, to await the pains of death, and steadily through all life to despond.
Reason might be right."] Who has read the ballad of 'Puir Mary Lee'?&mdash;that
old Scotch ballad, written I know not in what generation nor by what
hand. Mary had been ill-used&mdash;probably in being made to believe that
truth which is falsehood; she is not complaining, but she is sitting alone
in the snow-storm, and you hear her thoughts ... those of a deeply
feeling, strongly resentful peasant girl. Anguish has driven her from the
ingle-nook of home, to the white-shrouded and icy hills: crouched
under the 'cauld drift,' she recalls every image of horror, ... she hates
these, but 'waur' she hates 'Robin-a-Ree!'</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! ance I lived happily by yon bonny burn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The warld was in love wi' me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now I maun sit 'neath the cauld drift and mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And curse black Robin-a-Ree!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then whudder awa' thou bitter biting blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sough through the scrunty tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smoor me up in the snaw fu' fast<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And ne'er let the sun me see!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, never melt awa' thou wreath o' snaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That's sae kind in graving me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hide me frae the scorn and guffaw<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O' villains like Robin-a-Ree!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus internal evidence proves that the name of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> for the abode of the "deeply feeling, strongly resentful
peasant girl," Catherine Earnshaw, was primarily chosen by Charlotte
Bront&euml; because of its special appeal to her own mood at a given period,
in relation to the ballad of "Puir Mary Lee," and proves that the
choice of the name of Snowe for her "cold and altered" autobiographical
self in <i>Villette</i> was dictated by its connection therewith.</p>

<p>In this light glance at Charlotte Bront&euml;'s poem "Mementos,"
and at the following verses from her "Frances":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And when thy opening eyes shall see<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mementos, on the chamber wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one who has forgotten thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shed not the tear of acrid gall.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr class='tbp' />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vain as the passing gale, my crying;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though lightning-struck,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> I must live on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know, at heart, there is no dying<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of love and ruined hope alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr class='tbp' />
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The very wildness of my sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tells me I yet have innate force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My track of life has been too narrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Effort shall trace a broader course."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is an apparent relationship of this last verse with the
remarks in Chapter XXV. of <i>The Professor</i>, on Hunsden's "Lucia,"
of whom he says:&mdash;"I should ... have liked to marry her, and
that I <i>have</i> not done so is a proof that I <i>could</i> not." Lucia's (Miss
Bront&euml;'s) "faculty" was literature: the physiognomy was obviously
an obfuscation. It is significant that Charlotte Bront&euml; again took
"Lucia," for the Christian name of Lucia or Lucy Snowe. See my
references to Hunsden as a phase of M. H&eacute;ger.</p>

<p>Perceiving, therefore, that Charlotte Bront&euml; had likened herself to
the heroine of "Puir Mary Lee," in so far as to be influenced by it to
give the title of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> to one of her works, and to take
the name of Snowe later for her autobiographical self, we understand
why she wrote in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chapter XXVI.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman, ... was a
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate.
A Christmas frost [see my reference to the name of Lucy Frost] had come
at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice
glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and
cornfield lay a frozen shroud [see "the snow-storm, the white-shrouded
and frosty hills," the "cauld drift," the "whuddering blast," etc., of "Puir
Mary Lee" in <i>Shirley</i>], lanes which last night blushed full of flowers
to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, ... now
spread waste, wild, and white as pine forests in wintry Norway. My hopes
were all dead&mdash;struck with a subtle doom.... I looked at my love: that
feeling which was my master's&mdash;which he had created; it shivered in my
heart like a suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had
seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms&mdash;it could not derive
warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for
faith was blighted&mdash;confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>what he had been.... I would not say he had betrayed me: but the
attribute of stainless truth was gone from his idea [see "Robin-a-Ree"], and
from his presence I must go; <i>that</i> I perceived well.... That bitter hour
cannot be described: in truth, 'the waters came into my soul; I sank in
deep mire; I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed
me.'</p></div>

<p>The inclusion in <i>Shirley</i> of the ballad of "Puir Mary Lee"
and the remarks anent it were apparently digressive, but they are
followed by the "subtle" disclaimer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But what has been said in the last page or two is not germane to
Caroline Helstone's feelings, or to the state of things between her and
Robert Moore. Robert had done her no wrong; he had told her no lie;
it was she that was to blame, if any one was; what bitterness her mind
distilled should and would be poured on her own head.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, there is evidence of a reconciliation between M. H&eacute;ger
and Charlotte Bront&euml;, this being most marked in <i>Jane Eyre</i> and
<i>Shirley</i>. In connection with the reasons responsible for Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s choice of the title of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, it is interesting
to note some "subtlety of thought" dictated Charlotte's telling us in
<i>Shirley</i>, Chapter XXXIII., of Caroline and her lover that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The air was now dark with snow; an Iceland blast was driving it
wildly. This pair neither heard the long "wuthering" rush, nor saw the
white burden it drifted; each seemed conscious but of one thing&mdash;the
presence of the other.</p></div>

<p>After the close of 1850, Charlotte Bront&euml; resolved into the mood
which was an earlier characteristic; and the choice of the name of
Snowe for herself and the extraordinary tenacity with which she held
to the name, having it re-inscribed in <i>Villette</i> by the printers though
she had herself changed it, show she had returned somewhat to that
state in regard to her affection for M. H&eacute;ger responsible for the
passionateness of her <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. And as following the
completion of <i>Villette</i> she decided to marry a man she did not really
love, I would say her mood was honestly in sympathy with that in
which she wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i> through bitter, adverse circumstances
and the warping of destiny, and did not result from Sydney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Dobell's advice to her when, having read <i>Shirley</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
and despite her disclaimer in a preface, thinking she was the author
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, he advised her to resume the frame of mind
in which she had penned her <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Dobell's supposition that she wrote the book had no connection
whatsoever with my discovering Charlotte Bront&euml; was the author of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>; neither had the fact that Miss Rigby&mdash;Lady
Eastlake&mdash;in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>, spoke of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> as
"purporting to be written by Ellis Bell" but having "a decided
family likeness to <i>Jane Eyre</i>," and with still more point, identified
"Catherine and Heathcliffe of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> as Jane and
Rochester of <i>Jane Eyre</i> in their native state." For I early found I
must credit only the internal evidence of the Bront&euml; works as my
interpretative guide. Having written "The Key to <i>Jane Eyre</i>"
nothing could prevent my discovery of that novel's kinship with
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>; and so far back as August 29, 1902, I penned
in a private letter enclosed with the proof sheets of my article to
Mr. Harold Hodge, the editor of <i>The Saturday Review</i>, a confession
that I was finding a strong kinship between the two novels. I owe
to my persistent consciousness of this close kinship the fact that I
finally discovered the amazing secrets of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and was
enabled to state publicly in my <i>Fortnightly Review</i> article of March
1907, Charlotte Bront&euml; and none other wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.
It was then I turned with interest to the remarks of Sydney Dobell,
the author of <i>Balder</i>, and "a notable figure in the history of English
thought" as he has been named, whose review of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
works had resulted in her being acclaimed a leading author and a
genius. It was in <i>The Palladium</i> of September 1850 Sydney Dobell
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That any hand but that which shaped <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Shirley</i> cut
out the rougher earlier statues [in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>] we should
require more than the evidence of our senses to believe; ... the author
of <i>Jane Eyre</i> need fear nothing in acknowledging these ... immature
creations.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>... When Currer Bell writes her next novel, let her
re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>member ... the frame of mind in which she sat down to write her first
[<i>Wuthering Heights</i>]. She will never sin so much against consistent
drawing as to draw another Heathcliffe.... In <i>Jane Eyre</i> we find ...
only further evidence of the same producing qualities to which <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> bears testimony.</p></div>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; warmly thanked him and protested. With eager
honesty he again and again begged her to visit him and discuss the
authorship of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Could Sidney Dobell but have
been told the secret tragedy of Currer Bell's life and the bitterness
of her cup, how he would have shrunk from inflicting her with an
intrusive personal inquiry. And in all innocence he had asked her
to revive the frame of mind in which, to use the words in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
her heart had been "weeping blood"!</p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> was wrought near the furnace of Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s fiery ordeal, and gives at its intensest that which glows
through her other works, finally to flash up and smoulder out in
<i>Villette</i>. By reason of its clear portrayal of woman when she is very
woman <i>Wuthering Heights</i> towers above all common literary artistry,
one of the finest novels in the world, an abiding monument to the
vital genius of Charlotte Bront&euml;. After her return from Brussels
her life was a long human conflict, with vain regrets, vindictive
recriminations, and luring memories opposing heroic commandings
in the name of right and virtue. All honour to her that she fought
to win!</p>

<p>Had Charlotte Bront&euml; and M. H&eacute;ger been characterless individuals
of the common type who, knowing nothing of self-sacrifice
and nobleness of life, yield to the call of immediate and unlicensed
impulse, we could never have had these most vital representations,
these most poignant revelations of the Martyrdom of Virtue&mdash;the
works of our immortal Currer Bell. Her vehicle of confession&mdash;her
dialect, was what men have termed fiction. But her heart was
satisfied that truth has its ultimate appeal; and in the way of those
sententious writers of old who garbed in an attractive vesture
veritable and momentous records which would be preserved because
they entertained, she gave the history of her life in a series of dramas
we call the Bront&euml; novels. For sixty years these have been read
only as the creations of a brain that spun interesting fiction! Now,
by aid of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>, it is revealed they are more
than this, and we discover the real greatness of Currer Bell and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
high rank of her genius. Like that which creates the noblest and
most enduring of the world's literature, the genius of Charlotte
Bront&euml; truthfully preserves the past, while it will intimately appeal to
and have a salient lesson and an inspiring message for any one
so ever who shall read, be it here and now, or in the time to
come.</p>

<h3>THE BRONT&Euml; POEMS.</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Charlotte Bront&euml;</span> loved her sisters Emily and Anne, but in her
introduction to the poetical selections from their literary remains she
says little concerning their verse, preferring to give of each sister a
kind of short biographical memoir. In dealing with Emily she dwelt
poetically upon the features of the Yorkshire moors, and thus
extended to Emily's verses that atmosphere and charm which she
(Charlotte) had fixed in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>; and in
writing upon Anne she complained her verse gave evidence of a too
melancholy religious feeling. The eldest surviving child in the
Bront&euml; family, after the deaths of Maria and Elizabeth, it was
Charlotte Bront&euml; who would first set the ideal of literary composition
before the Bront&euml; children. To her initial impulse, therefore, owe
we the literary compositions that came from the pens of Emily, Anne,
and Branwell. Evidence of this truth is the fact that Emily, Anne,
and Branwell, in their writing, never got "right away," as the hunting
phrase has it.</p>

<p>There are many definitions of genius: may I define it as a
message? Charlotte Bront&euml; had a message. Emily had none.
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> and all the other works of Charlotte Bront&euml;, prose
and verse, had a vital message. Ellis Bell had no message. In a
sort of idle, ruminative contemplation Emily Bront&euml; constructed
verse unburdened with purpose&mdash;verse that became involved at the
moment it should have soared.</p>

<p>I believe we have the secret of what I may call Emily's "involved
moments" in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s description of her as Shirley Keeldar
in <i>Shirley</i>, Chapter XXII., wherein we are told Emily saw visions,
as it were, "faster than Thought can effect his combinations." We
feel something of the clouded chaos of her moment of writing in her
more impassioned or laboured verses; their illogic and incoherence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
fix it distressfully. Charlotte, to resume her reference to Emily in
<i>Shirley</i> above quoted, further tells us that "so long as she is calm,
indolence, indulgence, humour, and tenderness possess" her eye;
"incense her, ... it instantly quickens to flame." And with her
verse, so long as it was unburdened, indolent, it ran smoothly and
pleasantly along with the simplicity of the <i>insouciant</i>; but confronted
with magnitude the imagination flamed, reason and logic were
involved, and there was an end of art. In her excited combativeness
she hit out rashly. Thus in her last verses, considered her
masterpiece, she says the "thousand creeds" which move men's
hearts were "vain" to "waken doubt" in her creed, blind to the fact
that truth and worship finally converge to one point, howsoever
diverse their starting-places. The very unbeliever is a witness to
man's innate seeking for truth and right: he is a non-believer in this
or that because he conceives truth to be remote from it. He seeks
truth albeit he is a wide wanderer.</p>

<p>In "The Old Stoic" we have a "stoic" in Emily's r&ocirc;le of bold
challenger of chimera. "Courage to endure" and "a chainless
soul" are what this old stoic would ask for! The poet was ignorant
of or indifferent to the fact that a true stoic, according to the rule of
Epictetus, seeks to be not other than he is, and is content wheresoever
he be, whatsoever his lot. The words of this poem are those of
a bold neophyte, and they are interesting chiefly because we see
advanced in them the hypothesis of punishment common to Emily's
chimera-creating imagination. To repeat: so long as her mood was
calm her verse ran pleasantly and smoothly along. But the saying
tells us, "The good seaman is known in bad weather"; and so with
the poet. Life is not a placid lake: the lethal lightnings play, and
faith and happiness are threatened continually and on the whole
horizon.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml;, with memory of her own life-storm which has
left us her <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and her other great prose
works, wrote her introduction to Emily's poems in the spirit of one
who looked upon her pieces as the reflections of an uneventful life in
the inner sense of vital soul-conflict.</p>

<p>Anne Bront&euml;'s gentle poems, like Emily's, will appeal particularly
to such readers as have sympathetic temperaments; they will not call
to the human heart like the clarion notes of Charlotte Bront&euml;'s poem
"Passion," but mayhap their low whisperings may waken sadly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
pleasant memories. With Currer Bell's poems I deal in various
chapters, wherein we perceive their relationship to <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
and her other books which resulted from the harsh rigours of her
tempest-bestormed night.</p>

<p>And shall we not say a word for Branwell Bront&euml;? He too
wrote verse.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> He was not a genius in the sense of my definition, but
his verse is such as might appear in a member of a family a generation
or a degree of kin removed from the genius of the house. Him
we must remember compassionately as one physically weak, an
unhappy victim of circumstances against which he had not the moral
force to fight. Nor shall we forget that the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;, the
father, wrote and published verse. His productions were printed in
pamphlet form, and have been collected and republished.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> As
literature they are unimportant, but to the curious they may have a
sort of interest.</p>

<h1><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h1>

<hr class="full" />
<h2>MINOR IDENTIFICATIONS OF PERSONS AND PLACES<br />
IN THE BRONT&Euml; WORKS.</h2>


<h3>"<span class="smcap">Wuthering Heights.</span>"</h3>

<p>There is not satisfactory evidence to enable the identification of the
originals of Wuthering Heights the abode, and Thrushcross Grange.
Similar homesteads are found anywhere near the Yorkshire moors.
Architectural peculiarities and appointments are ever accretive properties
with the novelist of imagination and latitude. This observation should
be kept in mind also in regard to Charlotte Bront&euml;'s other works. See
my remarks on page 57.</p>


<h3>"<span class="smcap">Jane Eyre.</span>"</h3>

<p>The interior of Thornfield Hall, as I mention on page 35, has been
identified with that of "Norton Conyers," near Ripon; externally it has
been associated with "The Rydings," near Birstall. Ferndean Manor has
been identified with Wycollar Hall, near Colne. A Bront&euml; biographer
says this place was set on fire by a mad woman,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> but the story finds no
mention in <i>The Annals of Colne</i>, 1878, or in <i>Lancashire Legends</i>, 1873,
though "Wyecoller Hall" is dealt with at length in each work.</p>


<h3>"<span class="smcap">Shirley.</span>"</h3>

<p>Gomersall and Birstall, near Batley, Yorkshire, contribute to the background
of this story. "Field Head" has been identified with Oakwell
Hall, an Elizabethan mansion. Evidence shows that intimately the
Rectory in <i>Shirley</i> was in the main Haworth Parsonage to Charlotte
Bront&euml;. In <i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i> Leslie Stephen says:&mdash;"Bront&euml;,
... a strong Churchman and a man of imperious and passionate
character, ... is partly represented by Mr. Helstone in <i>Shirley</i>,
though a [Rev.] Mr. Roberson ... supplied ... characteristic traits."
And Mr. Francis Leyland, who drew much of his information from Nancy
Garrs, a Bront&euml; servant, says that the fourth chapter of <i>Shirley</i>, wherein<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Charlotte speaks of the grossly untrue reports of Mr. Helstone's dry-eyed
mourning, etc., for his wife, is a defence really of Mr. Bront&euml;. Helstone
was a composite character, as also was Mrs. Pryor, to whom, without
doubt, Miss Wooler contributed, though Charlotte Bront&euml; once had a
grave difference with her. Miss Nussey, who pathetically and wrongly
believed herself Caroline Helstone, proclaimed Miss Wooler, her schoolmistress,
as the prototype of Mrs. Pryor. Evidence declares, however,
that in many regards this character was also drawn from Tabitha
Aykroyd. And we see that Charlotte Bront&euml;, years before, in her
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, had given an ecclesiastical name&mdash;that of Dean&mdash;to
her portrayal of the one woman who alone ever took up the part of
mother for her&mdash;Tabitha Aykroyd. Nevertheless Mrs. Pryor was in the
main a composite character, largely at the service of "story" requirements.
Sometimes she is Tabitha, sometimes Miss Wooler; elsewhile
she is neither. Mr. Macarthey is said to represent the Rev. Arthur Bell
Nicholls, who became Charlotte Bront&euml;'s husband.</p>

<p>The references in <i>Shirley</i>, Chapters XII. and XXVII., to Robin
Hood's connection with Nunnwood and to the ruins of a nunnery, identify
Nunnely in the circumstances, with Hartshead, near Brighouse and
Dewsbury; Nunnely Church with Hartshead Church (Mr. Bront&euml; was
once vicar here), and the Priory with Kirklees Hall or Priory&mdash;Kirklees
Park, as we may see by turning to Dr. Whitaker's <i>Loidis and Elmete</i>,
pages 306-9 (1816), wherein we find mention of Robin Hood and an old
Cistercian nunnery in connection with Kirklees, appropriately now the
residence of Sir George J. Armytage, Bart., one of the founders of the
Harleian Society. Whinbury has been identified with Dewsbury; but I
do not know that it has been remarked the name Dewsbury may have
suggested to Charlotte Bront&euml; the dewberry, bramble, or blackberry, thus
leading her to adopt "whinberry" and, finally, Whinbury. The attack on
Hollow's Mill is said to have been founded on an attempt in 1812, when
an assault was made on the factory of Mr. Cartwright near Dewsbury.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"The Professor" and "Villette."</span></h3>

<p><i>The Professor</i>, Charlotte Bront&euml; offered to Messrs. Aylott &amp; Jones in
April 1846, was not published till after her death. It is related to
<i>Villette</i> in something of the way, though not so verbally and intimately,
that <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is to <i>Jane Eyre</i>. The early chapters deal vaguely
with a West Riding of Yorkshire town, but the scene quickly changes to
Brussels. The H&eacute;ger <i>pension</i> is recognized as the original of the schools
in both novels, but in <i>Villette</i> the place Villette occasionally becomes
London as Charlotte Bront&euml; knew it on her visits. Mr. George Smith,
the Bront&euml; publisher, and his mother, are portrayed as the Brettons.
Mr. Smith showed Charlotte Bront&euml; the sights of London: the theatres,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
picture galleries, churches, etc.; and we have reflected in <i>Villette</i> incidents
associated with her seeing these places.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The reader will find a phase
of Currer Bell in Paulina&mdash;Miss de Bassompierre, and a sympathetic
phase of Mr. Bront&euml; in her father, for after the deaths of Emily, Anne,
and Branwell, Charlotte and her father were brought closer to each
other. And like Mr. "Home" de Bassompierre, he had "no more
daughters and no son."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Towards the close of <i>Villette</i> we may find a
phase of the Rev. Mr. Nicholls, Charlotte Bront&euml;'s husband, in Dr. John
Bretton, my previous remarks upon whom observe. It was shortly after
the completion of <i>Villette</i> Mr. Nicholls proposed successfully, but it would
seem by the concluding chapters Miss Bront&euml; expected this. The picture
of the disappointment of the old father that his popular daughter would
marry a plain character in life suggests to us the disappointment of the
Rev. Patrick Bront&euml; in regard to his daughter's marrying a curate. See
Chapter XXXVII. Paulina, of course, is the feminine of Paul; and the
original of M. Paul of this work we now well know. See footnote on
page 120.</p>

<p>The chronological sequences in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s novels are seldom
carefully ordered: this should be remembered in reference to her
record of events in her own life.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"Agnes Grey" and "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall."</span></h3>

<p><i>Agnes Grey</i> contains simple and natural portrayals of governess life in
the eighteen-forties; and the following <i>Wildfell Hall</i>, we may conjecture,
is built from evolved incidents founded on hearsay and experience.
Whether Miss Bront&euml; had assisted Anne or not, it is certain <i>Wildfell
Hall</i> has something in common with Currer Bell's novels. The books
connected with the name of Acton Bell, however, are not important as
literature in the higher sense of the word; and though a member of Messrs.
Smith &amp; Elder remarked to Miss Bront&euml; upon a similarity in the leading
male characters of <i>Wildfell Hall</i> to Rochester, interest in it is merely
dependent upon its association with the greater Bront&euml; works, and the
book does not call for sedulous inquiry.</p>

<h2>THE H&Eacute;GER PORTRAIT OF CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;<br />
IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY.</h2>


<p>The Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery, London, purchased
in July 1906, a hitherto unheard of portrait of Charlotte Bront&euml;,
painted in water-colours in 1850, and stated to be by M. H&eacute;ger.
A reproduction of the portrait was given in <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>
for October 1906, Mr. Reginald J. Smith, K.C., of Messrs. Smith,
Elder &amp; Co., the Bront&euml; publishers, having to do with its discovery.</p>

<p>In the early autumn of 1906, Mr. Lionel Cust, M.V.O., Surveyor of
the King's Pictures and Works of Art, then Director of the National
Portrait Gallery, was busily corresponding with me in regard to this
portrait of Charlotte Bront&euml;, the authenticity of which became
sensationally attacked. At once I pointed out the importance and
significance of the portrait's being signed "Paul H&eacute;ger," instead of
"Constantin H&eacute;ger"; and other matters. In March 1907, I appended
a footnote<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to my article, "The Lifting of the Bront&euml; Veil," in <i>The
Fortnightly Review</i>, and on May 16th, 1907, the literary editor of
<i>The Tribune</i>, Mr. E. G. Hawke, having placed space at my disposal,
I wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h4>CHARLOTTE  BRONT&Euml;.</h4>

<p class="center">THE H&Eacute;GER PORTRAIT.</p>

<p class="center">To the Editor of <i>The Tribune</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;As the water-colour drawing by M. H&eacute;ger is now a valuable property
of the nation, and gives a more intimately faithful and characteristic
likeness of Charlotte Bront&euml; than the Richmond portrait of "Currer
Bell," now also hung in the National Portrait Gallery, kindly permit me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
publicly to present some of the many interesting facts connected with it.
The portrait is signed "Paul H&eacute;ger, 1850" (the accent is correct), and it
represents Miss Bront&euml; with curls, and reading <i>Shirley</i>, on one leaf of
which is a heart transfixed with an arrow. The dress that she wears is
light green, and on the back of the drawing is inscribed:</p>

<p class="negidt">The Wearin' of the Green; First since Emily's death; that being
the first occasion on which Miss Bront&euml; wore colours after the
death of her sister.</p>

<p class="noidt">And below:</p>

<p class="negidt">This drawing is by P. Heg&eacute;r (accent thus), done from life in 1850.
The pose was suggested first by a sketch done by her brother
Branwell many years previous.</p>

<p>The Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery acquired the portrait
from a lady whose family obtained it nigh on forty years ago from Mr.
Thomas Baylis, a personal friend of Lord Lytton. Mr. Baylis stated that
he himself had acquired the portrait from the H&eacute;ger family at Brussels.
The children of the Mme. H&eacute;ger who refused to see Mrs. Gaskell because
of her dislike to Miss Bront&euml;, aver that M. H&eacute;ger never drew or painted.
The statement, however, is directly opposed by indisputable evidence:</p>

<p class="negidt">(1.) The portrait is authentic, and was drawn from life in 1850, and
the inscriptions that it bears it is proved could have been inspired
by none other than Charlotte Bront&euml; herself or M. H&eacute;ger.</p>

<p class="negidt">(2.) The statement of Mr. Thomas Baylis, a well-connected gentleman.</p>

<p class="negidt">(3.) Eug&egrave;ne Sue, in his 1851 volume of <i>Miss Mary ou l'Institutrice</i>,
gives, with a clouding of mystery, a lover&mdash;G&eacute;rard de Morville&mdash;drawing
a portrait of Miss Mary "d'apr&egrave;s nature;" and M.
Sue's <i>feuilleton</i>, as I showed in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i> for
March, identifies Miss Mary and the de Morvilles as phases of
Charlotte Bront&euml; and the H&eacute;gers.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p class="negidt">(4.) Miss Bront&euml;, in <i>Shirley</i>, herself presents M. H&eacute;ger&mdash;Louis
G&eacute;rard Moore&mdash;as an artist, and refers to past drawing
episodes.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>The authenticity of the inscriptions is not involved in the question as
to whether Charlotte Bront&euml; would use careless spelling, for, if she had
written them, couching them in the third person, it is clear that she had
not desired to be known as the writer. Upon the other hand, it is
discovered to be utterly impossible for any one but Charlotte Bront&euml; or
M. H&eacute;ger to have inspired the inscriptions, whosoever wrote them.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Significant Pieces of Evidence.</span></p>

<p>I find that M. H&eacute;ger was Paul to none but Charlotte Bront&euml; in
1850, and that before the publication, two years ago, of <i>Charlotte Bront&euml;
and Her Sisters</i>, by Mr. Clement Shorter, who, for reasons which he
should explain, calls M. Constantin Gilles Romain H&eacute;ger "M. Paul
H&eacute;ger," [Throughout that writer's correspondence in <i>The Times</i>, etc., and
in <i>Charlotte Bront&euml; and Her Sisters</i>: beneath the portrait of M. H&eacute;ger,
facing page 198, and bearing the inscription:&mdash;M. Paul H&eacute;ger: The
Hero of <i>Villette</i> and <i>The Professor</i>; and on page 161 of that work] no
reference in print had been made to M. H&eacute;ger but as Constantin. The
H&eacute;gers state that M. H&eacute;ger was not called Paul, and that Dr. Paul
H&eacute;ger, his son, was the first member of the family named Paul.</p>

<p>A native of Haworth<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> who lived from 1830 till after the death of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Charlotte Bront&euml; in 1855, "within twenty yards of the Haworth Parsonage,"
her home, has pronounced the H&eacute;ger portrait of Miss Bront&euml; to be
a correct likeness and "just like her." He says that it reminds him of
her as he knew her and as she was in her younger days, and he pointed
out to me particularly that he had seen her with her hair as in the H&eacute;ger
likeness, "scores of times before she went away"&mdash;this giving the clue
to the reference in the inscription to a pose in a portrait by Branwell
"many years previous" to 1850; and I have seen a reproduction of a
sketch by Branwell wherein the Bront&euml; sisters have curls. Moreover, I
find that Miss Bront&euml; really liked curls and disliked the other styles,
though she conformed to the fashion.</p>

<p>I also find that the paper on which the H&eacute;ger portrait of Miss Bront&euml;
was drawn was that used in 1850 by the house where she was a guest in
London in the early June of 1850, at the very time to within a day when,
as there is indisputable evidence&mdash;despite assertions that she "never
under any circumstances during the later period of her life wore a green
dress"&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml; was wearing a light green dress. That was
"the first occasion on which Miss Bront&euml; wore colours," as the inscription
tells us, and fact substantiates, after she had concluded the remarkably
long mourning period for her sisters, which began with "the death
of Emily" and did not end till twelve months after the death of Anne,
who died on May 28th, 1849.</p>

<p class="ralign">(Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; J. MALHAM-DEMBLEBY.</p>
<p>Scarr Hill, Eccleshill, Bradford, May 16th, 1907.</p>
</div>

<p>The publication of this letter ended the controversy.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Since it
was published Mrs. Gaskell's daughters, who well knew Miss Bront&euml;,
have declared themselves fully satisfied as to the authenticity of the
H&eacute;ger portrait of Charlotte Bront&euml; and the faithfulness of the
likeness. The testimony of Lady Ritchie, Thackeray's daughter,
also supports this portrait. See my further references to my cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>respondence
with her ladyship herewith. As regards the green
dress, apart from the indisputable external evidence I referred to in
the printed letter, I believe Charlotte Bront&euml; speaks of it in <i>Villette</i>,
though therein it is for obfuscation's sake (necessary indeed, since
<i>Villette</i> was published only a short time after her London visit) made
"pink" and "flounceless." In Chapter XXVIII. we find M. Paul
saying&mdash;and it is interesting thus to have connected with the green
dress a character whose prototype was M. H&eacute;ger&mdash;that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Pink or scarlet, yellow or crimson, <i>pea-green</i> or sky-blue, [the dress]
was all one."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p></div>

<p>As I stated to Lady Ritchie in 1907, I believe that in Chapter
XX. of <i>Villette</i> we undoubtedly have a real glimpse of incidents connected
with the wearing of the green dress; and it should be
remembered that Mrs. Bretton and Dr. John Graham Bretton in
this chapter represent Mrs. Smith, and her son Mr. George Smith,
the publisher, whose guest Charlotte Bront&euml; was in 1850, when she
first wore the green dress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One morning, Mrs. Bretton ... desired me to ... show her my
dresses; which I did, without a word.</p>

<p>"That will do," said she.... "You must have a new one."</p>

<p>... She returned presently with a dressmaker. She had me
measured. "I mean," said she, "to follow my own taste, and to have
my own way in this little matter."</p>

<p>Two days after came home&mdash;a pink [green] dress! "That is not for
me," I said hurriedly, feeling that I would ... as soon clothe myself in
the costume of a Chinese lady of rank.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<p>... "You will wear it this ... evening."</p>

<p>I thought I should not; I thought no human force should avail to
put me into it.... I knew it not. It knew not me. I had not proved it.</p></div>

<p>But wear it she did; and when Graham [Mr. George Smith]
stood in the doorway looking at her, she tells us her uneasy
aspiration was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I <i>do</i> hope he will not think I have been decking myself out to draw
attention."</p></div>

<p>Clearly Charlotte Bront&euml; wished posterity to learn how it came
about she was garbed in "light fabric and bright tint," because the
green dress was a page in her life's history. In a green dress she
sat down to dine, as Mr. Thackeray's daughter, Lady Ritchie has
written me she well remembers, when Charlotte Bront&euml; dined at
Thackeray's house on June 12, 1850&mdash;not the event of the distinguished
party, when Carlyle, Miss Perry, Mrs. Procter, and others
were present, though Lady Ritchie had once confounded the two in
writing upon the subject<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. Mr. Thackeray's daughter was a young
girl at the time to which she referred, but she has made clear to me
she saw Miss Bront&euml; three times; that the chief occasion was when
Charlotte Bront&euml; wore the light green dress. This, to quote her
ladyship's words to me, was "not Mrs. Brookfield's party, when
neither my sister and I nor our governess dined&mdash;though we came
down in the evening. The second occasion was just casually at my
father's lecture-room, when she did not speak to me, and the third,
finally, at the Brookfield evening party, which seems to have been
such a solemn affair<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>."</p>

<p>These facts fix the wearing of the light green dress by Miss
Bront&euml; as June 12, 1850.  Lady Ritchie tells me that "It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
at an early family dinner by daylight with Charlotte Bront&euml;, my
father, Mr. George Smith, my sister and our governess, that I
remember sitting next Miss Bront&euml; at dinner and gazing at her <i>sleeve</i>
and mittens. Her dress was of some texture like one I had had
myself, which I suppose impressed it upon me, and it had a little
moss or coral pattern in green on a white ground. I only remember
the sleeve, the straight look, and the smooth Victorian bandeaux of
hair. I am sure she was <i>differently</i> dressed at the Brookfield evening
party."</p>

<p>On June 12, 1850, Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote to her friend, Miss
Nussey, from the Smiths' in London, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thackeray made a call.... If all be well, I am to dine at his house
this evening.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p></div>

<p class="noidt">And this was when Miss Bront&euml; sat in a light green dress at the
Thackeray dinner-table.</p>

<p>The Richmond portrait of Charlotte Bront&euml; being now also in
the National Portrait Gallery, I may remark that Mrs. Gaskell herself
says of this portrait:&mdash;"Those best acquainted with the original were
least satisfied with the resemblance.... Mr. Bront&euml; thought ...
it looked good and lifelike." Charlotte Bront&euml; herself said her
father thought the portrait looked older than she. In view of the
new interest now attaching to Tabitha Aykroyd and Charlotte, it is
instructive to find the latter telling us Tabitha "maintains that it
is not like," and also, that Tabitha thought it "too old looking."
Then she apologized for the old servant in a sentence that
pathetically recalls Mrs. Dean and Bessie of "Catherine's" and
"Jane's" childhood&mdash;"Doubtless she confuses her recollections of
me as I was in childhood, with present impressions."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> We discover,
therefore, that in the main there was really dissatisfaction
at the "old looking" presentation, and we see Charlotte Bront&euml; from
the beginning must have wished she had had her hair arrangement
in that portrait as was common to her at home and in her younger
days. Hence do we get a further insight into the origin of the
different pose in the more characteristic and intimately faithful
H&eacute;ger portrait of Charlotte Bront&euml;.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL KEY INDEX.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noidt"><span class="noidt">I stated</span> in a letter to <i>The Academy</i>, August 1st, 1908, that "were it
possible by application of a cipher code to discover the words 'Emily
Bront&euml;' in every sentence of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, I could not even then
say any one wrote the book but Charlotte Bront&euml;." If people write
before they think, then importance can be attached to clerical testimony
and external associations to the disadvantage of internal and literal
evidence. But inspiration, thought, and fact denote in questions of
authorship, and therefore that is author of a work whose thoughts and
words are expressed and inmost life revealed therein. <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, we now see, is Charlotte Bront&euml;, and it matters not what
amanuensis dealt with the relation&mdash;what sequence of complications
resulted from her first day of handing over the work to her sister, and of
conspiring to conceal her authorship.</p>

<p>Had not my own two sisters died, I might have been tempted to
make them novelists: out of my bottom drawer I could have provided
them with a novel each and one for a "follow-on," and yet have left
myself some maturer works in hand. But <i>my</i> sisters would have had to
copy out the manuscripts for the printers from my first drafts, and in
every way possible to merit and to establish association with the books
as authors. And how indignant we would have been&mdash;nay, alarmed, had
there been a "Newby arrangement," at some daring critic, like Lady
Eastlake and Sydney Dobell, imputing they were the work of one mind!
Would we not have appealed to clerical testimony? With a more
practised hand Charlotte Bront&euml; in her days of fame corrected and edited
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Emily was dead. Well might Charlotte say the
labour left her "prostrate and entombed." What memories had it recalled!&mdash;what
a history! It is obvious to all who consider carefully the
letter Charlotte Bront&euml; penned Wordsworth, to which I refer in the footnote
on page 17 of <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>, that she wrote her
books rapidly; and a review of the fact that the Bront&euml; school project
was renounced in favour of literary projects suggests Currer Bell in
1845-46 revealed to her sisters the advantages of having a bottom drawer.
Let any reader use what I have termed the Key Index to the works of
Charlotte Bront&euml;, and it will be perceived quite easily that <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> is irrefutably at one with Currer Bell and all her other books&mdash;that
the works of Charlotte Bront&euml; are all related to each other, to
Charlotte Bront&euml;, and to the facts and people of her life as seen and
known by herself. The reader of a given Bront&euml; work will glance down
the list in the Key Index under the heading of the particular book in
hand to find these very important and intensely interesting connections,
now first shown to exist:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> <i>The Bront&euml;s in Ireland</i>, by Dr. William Wright, 1893, and <i>The Bront&euml;
Homeland</i>, by J. Ramsden, 1897, though they conflict, deal interestingly with
Patrick Brunty's, or Bront&euml;'s, relations. "Patrick ... after being a linen
weaver secured the post of teacher in the Glascar School, Ballynaskeagh, then
that of teacher at Drumballyroney." Eventually he got a scholarship and
entered St. John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated and took Holy
Orders. His father was a Hugh Brunty, who married a Roman Catholic, Alice
McClory, or M'Clory. She is said to have become a Protestant, as was her
husband. Of this marriage there were ten children, the eldest being Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s father, who early took to "larnin'," to quote the Irish hearsay. <i>The
Bront&euml;s in Ireland</i> has been challenged as presenting many statements impossible
of verification. The assertion that an Irish Brunty foundling story suggested the
foundling of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> raised a harsh and voluminous controversy. The
Rev. Angus Mackay, in his little brochure <i>The Bront&euml;s&mdash;Fact and Fiction</i>, 1897,
controverted Dr. Wright, as did others elsewhere. The matter is summed up
succinctly by Mr. Horsfall Turner, the Yorkshire genealogist, in <i>The Rev.
Patrick Bront&euml;'s Collected Works</i>, 1898, where, speaking of the Irish Bront&euml;s and
the foundling story, he says:&mdash;"The only one who could transmit this story was
Hugh Brunty, and not one of his descendants ever heard of it before Dr. Wright's
book was issued, not even the vaguest tradition."</p></div>

Gaskell, were merely badly, or I may say, childishly, assimilated fragments from
English adaptations found in Dryden, Rowe, etc., of Lucan (Pharsalia, lib. 1, 73),
and of other ancient writers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Her correspondence is given in Sir Wemyss Reid's <i>Monograph on Charlotte

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Charlotte Bront&euml;, upon the other hand, was a most fluent writer of prose.
She sent Wordsworth a story in 1840, and spoke of her facility in writing novels.
(Mrs. Gaskell's <i>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</i>, pages 189-190, Haworth Edition.) It is
said Emily corrected misprints, etc., in her printed volume of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>;
but whether or not she did this at Charlotte Bront&euml;'s instigation is of little interest
and no importance in view of the literal evidence in <i>The Key to the Bront&euml; Works</i>.
It may be Emily turned Charlotte's amanuensis; and it would not be difficult to
show Anne Bront&euml; also had been Charlotte's understudy. See my remarks on

historian states that the Admiral&mdash;who, I may say, had been a great friend of
Richard Cromwell&mdash;perished in the sea-fight with De Ruyter, because he would
not leave his ship by a piece of obstinate courage, provoked by a reflection that
he took care more of himself than of the king's honour.</p></div>

Jabes Branderham. Lockwood's "dream" in the connection was evidently a
travesty on a sermon of the famous Rev. Jabes Bunting, a Wesleyan Methodist,
and the zealousness of his hearers, concerning which preacher stories were possibly
gathered by Charlotte Bront&euml; from old Tabitha, who doubtless did occasional
service as the old dialect-speaking Joseph. The Rev. Jabes Bunting was on the
Halifax Circuit in the eighteen-twenties, and his sermons were printed in pamphlet
form. Note the extract I have given from <i>Villette</i> on Lucy Snowe's having read

child. Thus the early references to the more active Ellen Dean and Bessie in
the main imply Tabby in the eighteen-twenties; those to her as the sedate and
glum Mrs. Dean and Hannah, as Tabby in the eighteen-forties. We see Tabby
quite in the caricature of Joseph in Charlotte's half-humorous references to her in
the diary-like descriptions of the Bront&euml; kitchen fireside life of her childhood in
1829, etc.&mdash;of which the rainy day incident in the childhood of little Catherine and
Jane is so reminiscent&mdash;quoted by Mrs. Gaskell in the Bront&euml; <i>Life</i>:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="ralign">
"June the 21st, 1829.<br />
</p>
<p>
"One night, about the time when the cold sleet of November [is] succeeded
by the snowstorms and the high, piercing night winds of winter, we were
all sitting round the warm, blazing kitchen fire, having just concluded a quarrel
with Tabby concerning the propriety of lighting a candle, from which she came
off victorious, no candle having been produced. A long pause succeeded, which
was at last broken by Branwell saying, in a lazy manner, 'I don't know what to
do.' This was echoed by Emily and Anne.
</p><p>
"Tabby: 'Wha ya may go t' bed.'
</p><p>
"Charlotte: 'Why are you so glum to-night, Tabby?'"
</p><p>
As time progressed Charlotte Bront&euml; viewed more sentimentally the associations
of her early childhood. Whenever Tabby was "Joseph" of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> Charlotte humorously caricatured her.</p></div>

novel, a work of the substantial number of 160,000 words, which I wrote in my
teens. It was published serially in <i>The Sheffield Independent</i> by Mr. Joseph
Cooke, beginning in May 1896 and running till September, under the title of
<i>Kalderworth</i>, a name I had compounded from the Yorkshire river Calder. Afterwards
the serial rights were also purchased by Sir Edward Russell and Mr. A. G.
Jeans, of <i>The Liverpool Post</i>, wherein the story ran serially as <i>Lawyer Vavasor's
Secret</i>. I did not choose Malham by reason of its being, as it is, the place from
which our family of Malham, or Malam, sprung: I had cycled over to the remote
village with my father. I was unaware that October 15 was an especial day at
Malham, nevertheless I began my story&mdash;<i>Kalderworth</i>:&mdash;
<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; "On the evening of the 15th of October, in the latter end of the Eighteen
Hundred and Eighties, as the sun sank greyly behind the distant skyline of those
wild hills that stretch from Malham and away into the North of Yorkshire, a
solitary horseman pushed his way over a hard moorland road to a little deserted
hamlet, where only one soul lived, and that a hag whose fame had spread as a
dabbler in the black art and the mischievous doctrines."<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;
I did not know of Montagu's book at the time; and of all the Bront&euml; novels I had
only read <i>Jane Eyre</i>. I remember once reflecting&mdash;while <i>Kalderworth</i> was being
published&mdash;that Charlotte Bront&euml; must have called her character Jane Eyre
after the river Aire, just as I had called my loosely composite village up in
Malhamdale Kalderworth, from the river Calder; and I thought Currer Bell, in
her choice of the name "Jane Eyre," had been actuated poetically by the fact of
the adjacency of the Yorkshire river Aire, or Ayre, and had changed the "A" in
Aire, just as I the "C" in Calder. Nor was it till years later that I knew
Charlotte Bront&euml; had written in <i>Shirley</i>, Chapter XIX., of "Calder or Aire
thundering in flood."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> That Gimmerton in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> means "the village of sheep" was
admitted years ago. The etymology is very obvious. We now have the circumstances

interesting insight into a love episode of Mr. Bront&euml;, during his first curacy, at
Wethersfield, near Braintree, Essex. Mr. Bront&euml; found a home with a Miss
Mildred Davy, with whose niece, a "comely damsel of eighteen&mdash;a Miss Mary
Mildred Davy Burder&mdash;with brown curls and blue eyes" he fell in love. A
plotting guardian uncle, however, removed Miss Burder and wrongly intercepted
all Mr. Bront&euml;'s letters. Subsequently Mr. Bront&euml; married Miss Maria Branwell,
of Penzance, visiting in Yorkshire, whom he married at St. Oswald's
Church, Guiseley, near Leeds. After the death of his wife, Mr. Bront&euml; offered
to marry Miss Burder, but was refused. She became the wife of the Rev. Peter
Sibree, of Wethersfield. Mr. W. W. Yates' book, <i>The Father of the Bront&euml;s</i>,
1897, shows us Mr. Bront&euml; as a curate at Dewsbury. Mr. Yates, who is the
originator of the Bront&euml; Society and Museum, rightly associated Mr. Bront&euml;
with Mr. Helstone of <i>Shirley</i>, supporting his contention by evidence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> For story and other purposes Miss Bront&euml; makes St. John Rivers ask Jane's
hand in marriage; and of course as the original of Moor House has been supposed
to be at Hathersage in Derbyshire, and it was there the Rev. Henry Nussey lived&mdash;Miss
Nussey's brother&mdash;who had offered to marry Charlotte Bront&euml;, Mrs.
Gaskell's Bront&euml;'s <i>Life</i> and a following (including even a recent catalogue of the
Bront&euml; Museum, wherein reference is made to Mr. Nussey's portrait!) have given
it forth that Mr. Nussey was the original of St. John Rivers&mdash;notwithstanding
that Mr. Nussey was a married man when Charlotte was visiting at Hathersage.
That Mr. Nussey and St. John Rivers are wholly dissimilar is contended at length
in <i>Charlotte Bront&euml; and Her Sisters</i>, pp. 166-170.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> Mr. Rochester's remarks in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Chapter XII., on Jane's drawings
would seem to show that though M. H&eacute;ger, the original of this character, was
interested in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s gift as an artist (and we know she sent M. H&eacute;ger
a drawing of hers as late as August 1845), he spoke of them in disparagement&mdash;a
fact that alone argues he was her superior in art, and understood drawing.
Indeed, after seeing the various water-colour and other drawings of Charlotte
Bront&euml;, some thirty of which, including "a pencil drawing of Louis Philippe of
France, drawn by C. Bront&euml; during her stay in Brussels," are numbered with the
Bront&euml; relics, I may say we can take it as really the expression of M. H&eacute;ger concerning
her sketches when Mr. Rochester observes of Jane's efforts in drawing:&mdash;"You
have secured the shadow of your thought, but no more probably. You
had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give it being," for this is the
truth concerning Charlotte Bront&euml;'s efforts of the kind. Nevertheless, I find
evidence of a Brussels tradition in the eighteen-fifties that she was clever as a
painter, M. Sue giving ability to his Miss Mary in this direction. It is more
emphasized in his <i>feuilleton</i> than volume portrayal of this "Institutrice," both of
which works we shall see presented phases of Miss Bront&euml; as she was known.
Hence we read, "Eh bien! monsieur, trouvez-vous <i>qu'elle sait un peu dessiner</i>,
<span class="smcap">MA</span> <i>Miss Mary</i>?" The italics, etc., are M. Sue's.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> It is sad indeed to find Charlotte Bront&euml; confessed, shortly before her
marriage to the Rev Mr. Nicholls, that there was no such sympathy between herself
and her prospective husband. See letters of Miss Catherine Winkworth in
<i>Memorials of Two Sisters: Susanna and Catherine Winkworth</i> (1908). Miss
Winkworth and Miss Bront&euml; discussed the matter personally. Miss Catherine
Winkworth wrote of Mr. Nicholls and Charlotte Bront&euml;:&mdash;"I am sure she will
be really good to him. But I guess the true love was Paul Emanuel [of <i>Villette</i>]
after all ... but I don't know, and don't think that Lily [Mrs. Gaskell] knows."
I should say that Mrs. Ratcliffe of Haworth&mdash;Tabitha Brown: her sister, Martha
Brown, was one of the Bront&euml; servants&mdash;at whose house Tabitha Aykroyd
breathed her last, stated to me on February 21st, 1907, that as to Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s "wedded life, they lived happily together." Often do we discover
references to the elective affinities in regard to M. H&eacute;ger and Charlotte Bront&euml; in
Currer Bell's works. Thus we did not need that Rochester should say in the
last chapter but one of <i>Jane Eyre</i>:&mdash;"I am not better than the old lightning-struck
chestnut," for we had understood by the touching apostrophe in <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, Chapter XXV., that he and Jane were implied. The words were:&mdash;"The
cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong
roots kept them unsundered below; ... they might be said to form one tree&mdash;a
ruin, but an entire ruin. 'You did right to hold fast to each other,' I said,
as if the monster splinters were living things; ... 'the time of pleasure and
love is over with you; but ... each of you has a comrade to sympathize with.'"
And Rochester tells Jane:&mdash;"You are my sympathy&mdash;my better self; ...
a fervent ... passion ... wraps; my existence about you&mdash;and kindling in
... powerful flame, fuses you and me in one." M. H&eacute;ger as M. Paul in <i>Villette</i>
strikes the same note we hear in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>:&mdash;"We
are alike&mdash;there is affinity between us.... Tremble! for where that is the
case with mortals, the threads of their destinies are difficult to entangle."</p></div>

from <i>The Weekly Times</i> Office, which ran M. Sue's <i>feuilleton</i>, was well-known
in French literary circles in the eighteen-forties. He founded in Paris <i>The London

there was some sort of understanding between him and Eug&egrave;ne Sue to set before
the world an interpretation of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, with the extraordinary information come
privily to M. Sue. Some time after its publication, Mr. Reynolds stated that
"the main incidents in 'Mary Lawson' were founded on actual realities." This we
shall find. It is a remarkable fact in the circumstances that <i>The London Journal</i>
for August 1, 1846&mdash;a year before <i>Jane Eyre</i> was published, printed on one page
the opening instalment of M. Sue's <i>Martin the Foundling</i>, and Charlotte Bront&euml;'s
poem "The Letter," with a footnote&mdash;"From a volume entitled <i>Poems by Cuvier

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> This artifice of presenting more than one phase of a character in the same
work is equivalent to that practised by the portrait-painter who uses mirror effects
to reveal some feature of his subject not in the ordinary line of vision. It was as
difficult for M. Sue to present a complete portrait of the successful, f&ecirc;ted Miss
Bront&euml; in poor Lagrange as it was for Charlotte Bront&euml; to present a complete
portrait of herself in the unhappy Lucy Snowe of <i>Villette</i>. So M. Sue also used
the phase of Miss Mary, and Charlotte Bront&euml; that of Paulina&mdash;just as she gave us
M. H&eacute;ger as Crimsworth and occasionally as M. Pelet of <i>The Professor</i>, and just
as she gave us herself in <i>Shirley</i> as Caroline Helstone and again (in regard only
to her relations with M. H&eacute;ger) as Shirley Keeldar. Methods which were
responsible for her first portraying herself as the elder Catherine of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and then as the younger Catherine, in which work M. H&eacute;ger was portrayed
by her often as Heathcliffe and finally as Hareton Earnshaw. With
Charlotte Bront&euml;, however, her secondary adaptations as portrayals, perhaps on
account of their improvization, frequently give evidence of being unprepared.
Thus the childhood of Paulina of <i>Villette</i> is scarcely Charlotte Bront&euml;'s; and
Hareton Earnshaw of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, save for the lover and pupil phase, was
never M. H&eacute;ger.</p></div>

the Bront&euml; novels instanced this passage as showing Emily Bront&euml;'s extravagant
love for the moors, inferring she preferred the heath to heaven. But Mrs. Ward
in these same "Introductions" even argued that <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Jane
Eyre</i> were dissimilar in characterization and style. Catherine's reference herewith
in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, to a "subliminal" existence in a lover and to the notion
that the absence or loss of such a love (and hence, limiting of the bounds of
existence,) would make the universe a blank, having no sympathy or relation&mdash;a
stranger, is at one with Charlotte Bront&euml;'s further words in her poem,
"Frances":&mdash;</p>

Patrick Bront&euml; and his only surviving daughter cannot be too strongly emphasized.
A most touching narration of him and the dying Currer Bell, related by Martha
Brown, the Bront&euml; servant, and herself the eye-witness, is given by Mr. William
Scruton, in <i>Thornton and The Bront&euml;s</i>, page 133 (1898):&mdash;"When Charlotte
heard her father coming upstairs to her, she would strain every nerve to give him
a pleasing reception. On his entering the room she would greet him with, 'See,
papa, I am looking a little better.'" Mr. Home was "papa" to Paulina. Compare
the lightsome Paulina with the younger Catherine of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>; and
Mrs. Home's death, <i>Villette</i>, chap, xxiv., with Mrs. Helstone's <i>Shirley</i>, chap. iv.</p></div>

attacking the authenticity of the H&eacute;ger portrait, were written by Mr. Shorter.
My footnote in <i>The Fortnightly</i> ran:&mdash;"In attacking the water-colour portrait of
Charlotte Bront&euml; purchased by the Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery, the
discovery of which, signed 'Paul H&eacute;ger, 1850,' was inimical to Mr. Clement
Shorter's contention that Charlotte Bront&euml; had but distantly interested M. H&eacute;ger,
Mr. Shorter said, 'M. H&eacute;ger certainly did not know even in 1850 that Miss
Bront&euml;, his old pupil, and Currer Bell were identical,' and with another asserted
M. H&eacute;ger and Charlotte Bront&euml; never met after 1844. We shall see here,
however, that M. H&eacute;ger knew all Miss Bront&euml;'s literary secrets in 1850, and that
they must have met after 1844, for M. H&eacute;ger could have acquired these secrets
only in most intimate conversation with Currer Bell herself: to none other would
she have revealed them."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> In this connection it is of interest to read the remarks of one of the jealous
de Morville women on this portrait of the Irish governess:&mdash;"Patience! ...
qui vivra verra. Je garde ce portrait de mademoiselle miss Mary, &ccedil;a me fera souvent
penser &agrave; elle&mdash;&ccedil;a m'emp&ecirc;chera de l'oublier. Je vais la clouer &agrave; quatre &eacute;pingles sur
le papier de ma chambre".... She threatens to stick pins in it.... "Oui, oui,
la belle Anglais!" she afterwards exclaims; "ce n'est pas seulement ton portrait
que je perce &agrave; coups d'&eacute;pingle, c'est toi-m&ecirc;me!" Which would suggest that a
portrait of Charlotte Bront&euml; could have remained at the H&eacute;ger establishment but
at risk of being destroyed. I may observe these mysterious references occur only
in the 1851 volume; not in the 1850 <i>feuilleton</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_98_98" id="Footnote_98_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> Mr. Greenwood Dyson, born in 1830 in the Fold opposite the White Lion
Hotel, in the house now a blacksmith's shop. "I was married in 1850," he
stated to me, "and was living about twenty yards from Haworth Church when
Charlotte Bront&euml; gave a black silk dress to my wife." The Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;
signed a testimonial saying he well knew Mr. Dyson as being reliable and trustworthy,
as also did the Rev. A. B. Nicholls, Miss Bront&euml;'s husband. I have
examined the document. An interesting glimpse of Charlotte Bront&euml; I have not
seen in any work is one of Mr. Dyson's reminiscences. He tells me that "there
was a draw-well situated in the kitchen of the Rectory from which we boys used
to draw water for domestic purposes." He added that often he drew water for
Charlotte Bront&euml; or others of the Bront&euml; household before drawing for himself.
"In one of the upper windows," he once wrote me, "a board had been placed
instead of one of the panes of glass, in the centre of which was bored a hole in
which Miss Bront&euml; inserted a telescope to take observations." Perceiving in conversation
with him the genuine pleasure the sight of the H&eacute;ger portrait of
Charlotte Bront&euml; gave Mr. Dyson, I later forwarded him a large photograph,
taken direct from the original H&eacute;ger drawing of Charlotte Bront&euml; in the National
Portrait Gallery. I print his reply to me written on March 2, 1907:&mdash;
